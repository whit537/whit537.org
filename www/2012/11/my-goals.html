<p>There was a guy a while ago who was on a kick about adding &ldquo;<a
    href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/business/19entre.html?pagewanted=all">the
    game layer</a>&rdquo; to everything. Dunno where he is now, but he&rsquo;s
kind of right. As life becomes more comfortable, it does seem that goals become
more trivial, as if in a game, and less weighty. Disturbingly, we even overtly
<a
    href="https://twitter.com/AdrianChen/status/269273564694331392">gamify
    war</a> now. My goals aren&rsquo;t survival-level concerns like finding
food and shelter, or even really earning a wage.</p>

<p>What are my gamified goals? Some people try to grow the number on their bank
account.  Jill Kelley chases <a
    href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/military/macdill/jill-kelley-outraged-other-military-liaisons-with-her-flirty-ways/1261619">meaningless
    honorifics</a>. These days, I find myself more drawn to Facebook likes and
comments, Twitter followers and retweets, upvotes and karma on Hacker News, and
website pageviews.  Michael Brutsch, the troll known as violentacrez, pointed
to Reddit karma in his <a
    href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6plIjdaVGA#t=9m50s">CNN interview</a>
as the motivation for his behavior, like a mouse &ldquo;that pushes the button
and gets the food pellet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I watched Andrew McAfee&rsquo;s TEDx talk on how <a
    href="http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_mcafee_are_droids_taking_our_jobs.html">droids
    are taking all our jobs</a>, including knowledge work. To the extent that
he&rsquo;s right, we will lose our remaining work-related goals. Yet, as
gamification suggests, humans seem to want (need?) goals, whether it&rsquo;s to
escape from slavery or finish making an indie video game or just rack up <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whuffie">wuffie</a>. Even some sort of
spiritual disavowal of goals is ...  a goal. It seems that a way to rephrase
McAfee&rsquo;s parting question is, what goals are appropriate in a
post-scarcity economy? Maybe it&rsquo;s Reddit karma. Hopefully it&rsquo;s
not drone kills.</p>

<p>My long-term goals are:</p>

<ol>

    <li>To establish <a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a> as a major
    economic platform</li>

    <li>To establish <a
        href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/26350459746/the-first-open-company">open
        companies</a> as a significant organizational structure</li>

    <li>To articulate <a href="http://abstract.io/n">abstract.io/n</a> as a
    nice minimalist philosophy</li>

    <li>To articulate <a href="http://xmin.org/">XMin</a> as a nice minimalist
    religion</li>

    <li>To enjoy life with my family and friends and neighbors and all of
    you :-)</li>

</ol>

<p>I see these goals as suitable for today, and hopefully of ongoing relevance
in our continuing shift towards post-scarcity. Certainly they are high up on
Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs. I expect that they&rsquo;re also suitably
complex and challenging to spend a career on&mdash;more satisfying than simply
chasing upvotes.</p>


<h2>Whence?</h2>

<p>Curious about how these goals have developed over time, I just browsed
through the previous posts on this blog, and came up with the following related
items.  I&rsquo;ll let you draw your own conclusions. For my part I&rsquo;m
encouraged by what I see as a convergence over the past five years. Am I
finally finding my place in the world? :-)</p>

<p>At one point, I remember articulating a life goal of &ldquo;presenting each
other as pure offerings to Yahweh on the Day of Christ.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d like
to bracket the matter of such supersensible goals for now until abstract.io/n
and XMin are further along. Thanks.</p>
