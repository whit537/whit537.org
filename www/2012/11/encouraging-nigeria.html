<p>Three months ago I <a
    href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/27072581481/i-believe-in-gittip">left a
    comfortable full time job</a> in order to build <a
    href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a>, a platform for sustainable
crowd-funding. Since Gittip is funded on Gittip, I need some part-time work to
pay the bills while Gittip gets off the ground. Thankfully, my former employer,
YouGov, decided to keep me on as a contractor, but for a while there I was
looking for freelance work (and thanks to everyone who offered!).</p>

<p>The most interesting lead I got was from a Nigerian government official.
It&rsquo;s a regrettable sign of the times that I was immediately suspicious,
as is pretty much anyone else I mention this to here in the United States. For
whatever reason, Nigeria is <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_scam">famously</a> and
disproportionately associated with Internet fraud.  I engaged the conversation
anyway. Long story short, this is legit. I wish I could take the job, but I
need to stay focused on Gittip, and YouGov is the best way for me to do that.
However, my Nigerian contact has expressed consternation at not being able to
find good technology partners to work with, and I promised that I would try to
help.</p>

<p>I have corresponded with Muyiwa since July over email, Twitter, and Skype,
and I can vouch for him. He&rsquo;s not a scammer. He&rsquo;s a capable
official with great intentions and a lot of energy looking to improve the
health care system and raise the standard of living in his state. I would be
proud to work with him.</p>


<h3>The Project</h3>

<p>Muyiwa has an expansive vision for using technology to improve delivery of
health care in his state. Much of Oyo State is rural, and basic cell phones are
prevalent even where smart phones or Internet access are not. Therefore we have
been talking about using text messaging to improve information flow for his
department. He&rsquo;s particularly keen on using open source tools and
contributing back to the open source community.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the latest part of our email exchange:</p>

I think we should talk about how to proceed, perhaps
with a small and manageable 'proof of principle'
project.

For example, We just received and distributed malaria
drugs donated by USAiD to about 600 primary health
care facilities for free dispensing to patients. I am
very interested in tracking the supply levels for these
drugs because we have had reports and complaints from
the public about not being able to get the drugs and/
or sometimes being charged for them.

I would also like us to contribute to development of
the platform as we adapt, customize and integrate it
with other solutions. To this end I would like us to
create our own instances and perhaps set up a github
account for the ministry to share the code.

I have secured initial funding (which is another
reason I have been silent- I wanted to be sure I could
immediately put my money where my mouth is :-))

Please let's talk soon but if you are still interested
you could send me a draft MOU or contract so we can
firm up the engagement.

Thanks and look forward to hearing from you.

Good to hear from you! What is the timeframe like
on the USAID malaria project? If the drugs have
already been distributed I'm guessing it is a
pressing project to collect data?

Here is my understanding of the user experience we
need to support:

  1. Clinic staff report on supply levels via SMS
     on a daily basis
  2. Members of the public can report problems via
     SMS, such as drugs going out of stock or being
     charged
  3. Ministry officials including yourself can
     monitor supply levels and problems on a
     dashboard

As such, I am seeing three phases to this work:

  1. Build the data collection system and dashboard.
  2. Train clinic staff on use of the system for
     reporting supply levels.
  3. Develop and implement a marketing plan for
     informing the general public about the problem
     reporting system.

My assumption is that the dashboard should give
Ministry officials the ability to set initial supply
levels of drugs delivered to each clinic, and the
ability to make manual adjustments as needed. Supply
levels would be decremented as clinic staff file SMS
reports.

Both clinic staff and the general public will send
SMS messages to a single long code phone number. We
will find hosting for a GSM modem to accept these
incoming texts and hand them off for processing by
the dashboard.

Is the problem reporting system necessary for this
pilot project, or should we focus on validating the
technology with clinic staff alone?

I will put together a proposal based on the above
understanding. Please correct me if I'm
misunderstanding any requirements.

Yes it is a pressing project, not only because the
malaria drugs have been distributed but because we will
begin distributing other essential drugs within the
next 3-4 weeks

Yes this accurately summarizes the required functionality

I agree with how you've phased the project.

I think we should include the problem reporting system
in the pilot as it will give us a way of validating the
reports. Currently the only way for someone to report
if they are denied service or drugs is through a long
and cumbersome petition process. I fear that if we are
rely on staff reports alone we may not know if we are
receiving falsified figures. Ideally the problem reporting
system should also have a way of sending out polls to
customers in targeted locations.


I hope we can include as much mapping. And GIS
functionality in the pilot project as well?

You understand the requirements perfectly and I look
forward to your proposal. Thanks!

<p>We had been looking at existing platforms like <a
    href="http://ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a> and <a
    href="http://www.frontlinesms.com/">FrontlineSMS</a>. As far as I can tell,
the technical challenge in either case is to collect inbound SMS messages. I
started looking into <a
    href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sms%20hosting">SMS hosting
    services</a>. Another option is to buy a GSM modem and put it in a server
yourself.  I believe Muyiwa has done this before, actually, for an election
monitoring project. Once the modem is installed, you can apparently get at it
with drivers like <a href="https://github.com/adammck/rubygsm">RubyGSM</a> and
<a
    href="https://github.com/adammck/pygsm">pyGSM</a>. There&rsquo;s a REST
server wrapping pyGSM called <a
    href="https://github.com/developmentseed/slingshotSMS">SlingshotSMS</a>.
I&rsquo;m not sure what value Ushahidi and FronlineSMS add over a custom Rails
or Django app that talks to the modem directly.</p>

<p>I did blink-test Muyiwa with some U.S.-normal consulting rates, and he was
fine. We didn&rsquo;t negotiate a final price though, and I&rsquo;ve never
billed him, so while I think it should be worth your while I can&rsquo;t say
for sure.</p>


<h3>The Bigger Picture</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that stereotypes about Nigerians hurt people like Muyiwa
who are genuinely trying to do good. On the other hand, every positive
encounter with the mainstream Internet shifts the incentive a little bit
further away from fraud. If you are interested in solving interesting tech
challenges to improve the health care system in Oyo State, while contributing
to open source, making money, <i>and</i> chipping away at Nigerian fraud, then
<a
    href="mailto:muyiwa.gbadegesin@oyostate.gov.ng">get in touch with
    Muyiwa</a> and take the job I wish I could take.</p>
