    <p><a href="http://xoxofest.com/">XOXO</a> was great because it
    subverted my personal perceptions of fame. There were a number of
    relatively well-known people at XOXO, and I recognized so relatively
    few of them that I could rarely tell whether the person I was about to
    introduce myself to was &ldquo;famous&rdquo; or not. This shined a
    light for me on my personal biases and hang-ups around fame.</p>

    <p>One person I did recognize was <a
        href="https://twitter.com/timoreilly">Tim O&rsquo;Reilly</a>. I
    made a point to chase him down and awkwardly introduce myself and shove
    a business card in his hand. Blech. Sorry, Tim. Two hours later I
    happened to be in the right place at the right time to introduce Tim to
    <a href="https://twitter.com/danharmon">Dan Harmon</a>. This was right
    after Dan&rsquo;s keynote, and I ended up tagging along when their
    group went out for drinks, where I met a bunch more people and had a
    good time. Eventually Tim left and Dan left, and I felt relieved, to be
    honest. I felt like I could let my, &ldquo;Oh shit, I&rsquo;m around
    famous people&rdquo; guard down a bit. And I did, and I had an even
    better time with some <a href="https://twitter.com/joeks">great</a> <a
        href="https://twitter.com/activefree">new</a> <a
        href="https://twitter.com/eriiicam">friends</a> discussing all
    sorts of interesting things like collective memory and the value of
    psychedelics and access to technology. And then the next day I
    discovered that <a href="https://twitter.com/jennydeluxe">Jenna
        Wortham</a> has half a million Twitter followers.</p>

    <p>I got to thinking, just how diverse is the XOXO crowd in terms of
    fame? So I scraped the list of Twitter screen names from the XOXO
    website, and used the Twitter API to get the <a
        href="data.csv">data</a> for following and followers
    (<code>friends_count</code> and <code>followers_count</code> in the
    API). Then I plotted the following chart, showing the log of the number
    of Twitter followers for each attendee along the X axis, and the log of
    the number they&rsquo;re following along Y.</p>

    <h2>Followers vs. Following of XOXO Attendees (N = <span
            id="N-plot-xoxo"></span>)</h2>

    <canvas id="plot-xoxo"></canvas>

    <p>The thing I notice about this chart is that there are no clumps.
    It&rsquo;s not like there were a bunch of big names, and then a mass of
    the rest of us. It looks really evenly distributed to me. It&rsquo;s
    also interesting to see the fairly well-defined upper and lower bounds
    on the ratio of followers to following. In another <a
        href="http://gist.io/3593759">context</a> I&rsquo;ve considered
    that ratio as a possible indicator of abuse, and if we can assume of
    XOXO attendees that they are not abusing Twitter (some of them, in
    fact, building it for us), then this plot seems to indicate that there
    might be something to that idea. I&rsquo;ve started working on
    comparing XOXO to Twitter overall, using the ASU Twitter <a
        href="http://socialcomputing.asu.edu/datasets/Twitter">dataset</a>,
    but that&rsquo;s proving more difficult to compute (a pseudo-random
    sample of 500 users takes me about 40 minutes to compute with my
    current algorithm, and shows way too many users in the single digits on
    both axes: Twitter appears to be sparsely populated). It would also be
    interesting to do comparisons to other conferences, perhaps by mining
    <a href="http://lanyrd.com/">Lanyrd</a>.</p>

    <p>In any case, fame is an axis of diversity that I don&rsquo;t usually
    think of, and it looks like XOXO really nailed fame diversity. How? I
    think having open enrollment helped. Yes, XOXO was a high-demand event,
    due to the reputation of the organizers. The only reason most of us
    made it to XOXO was because we happened to be paying attention to
    Twitter at just the right moment, when the conference was first
    announced. Insofar as that&rsquo;s true, it seems to indicate that how
    frequently one uses Twitter is independent of the number of followers
    and friends one has.  (Of course, having money and time to spend on
    XOXO was also a factor.)</p>

    <p>XOXO&rsquo;s fame diversity makes me question my bias against
    exclusive events. I&rsquo;ve had this negative impression of events
    like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp">Foo Camp</a>, <a
        href="https://brooklynbeta.org/">Brooklyn Beta</a>, <a
        href="http://buildconf.com/">Build</a> and <a
        href="http://codemash.org/">CodeMash</a> as cliques of the
    well-connected. I had XOXO in the same box in other respects, so
    it&rsquo;s surprising to me that well-connectedness was largely
    irrelevant there.  While Twitter is only one measure of connectedness,
    it&rsquo;d be interesting to see the data for these other conferences.
    Is Foo Camp less fame-diverse for being invite-only? Do the same people
    attend Brooklyn Beta every year? It&rsquo;d also be fun to look at more
    general events like <a href="http://www.aspenideas.org/">Aspen
        Ideas</a> and even <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a>, if
    attendee data were available.</p>

    <p>After XOXO I&rsquo;m more likely to try to get in to exclusive
    events. Exclusivity, fame-bias, and cliquishness are separate concerns,
    and exclusivity does not necessarily imply the other two.  Certainly,
    part of the value of XOXO was in its small, intimate size.  Can it stay
    exclusive&mdash;that is, intimate&mdash;while remaining fame-diverse
    and not falling into cliquishness? We shall see. In the mean time, I
    have my eye on <a href="https://brooklynbeta.org/beyond">Brooklyn Beta
        Beyond</a>.</p>

    <h2>So What?</h2>

    <p>To me, diversity is not an end in itself, it&rsquo;s how to enrich
    conversation. Exploring the world and identifying challenges and
    meeting them together and celebrating our achievements makes life fun.
    The more and diverse people there are at the table, the more we can
    explore and see and solve. And while XOXO brought an amazing group of
    people together, it fell a bit short for me in terms of the depth of
    the conversation, mostly through my own fault.</p>

    <p>One of my favorite conversations at XOXO was over lunch with

    <a href="https://twitter.com/chaddickerson">Chad Dickerson</a>,
    <a href="https://twitter.com/furtivecode">Chris Lamothe</a>,
    <a href="https://twitter.com/flipzagging">Neil Kandalgaonkar</a>, and
    <a href="https://twitter.com/uvince">Vince Maniago</a>.

    I asked why <a
        href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/29914417845/more-bazaars-and-better">Wikipedia
        isn&rsquo;t better than it is</a>. Well, it turns out that
    Wikipedia has some serious cultural and technical constraints
    it&rsquo;s dealing with, and that mobile might be Wikipedia&rsquo;s
    best chance at breaking with the past and making some bigger changes.
    But even then there is no absolute truth about what Wikipedia should
    be, and it falls to the messy languages of politics and organizational
    leadership to think about how to move Wikipedia from one place to
    another. I wish I&rsquo;d pursued more substantive conversations like
    this at XOXO.</p>

    <p>I loved Dan&rsquo;s keynote because he laid bare this really big
    question about the role of money in &ldquo;people connectors&rdquo;
    (his phrase for mediators of culture such as newspapers, TV, and the
    Internet). I saw a contrast in Adam&rsquo;s <a
        href="http://www.tested.com/videos/442491-adam-savages-keynote-xoxo-festival/">keynote</a>,
    where he &ldquo;frames his obsession with making and replicating movie
    props as a conversation with popular culture.&rdquo; Okay, but
    what&rsquo;s the <em>content</em> of the conversation? Adam&rsquo;s
    keynote was fun, Dan&rsquo;s was important (and, don&rsquo;t get me
    wrong, hilarious). I actually ended up at drinks with Adam and Dan,
    among others, after Adam&rsquo;s keynote, and I regret not having
    followed up on this, constipated as I was by fame.</p>

    <p>This interest in deepening the conversation is also behind a <a
        href="https://twitter.com/whit537/status/247725423482523649">recent</a>
    <a
        href="https://twitter.com/whit537/status/247740257225830400">Twitter</a>
    <a
        href="https://twitter.com/whit537/status/247742739809198080">exchange</a>
    about the idea of inviting something like <a
        href="http://www.kiva.org/">Kiva</a> to be a part of the next
    iteration of XOXO. Okay, it&rsquo;s first and foremost an art festival.
    That&rsquo;s a gestalt I didn&rsquo;t really take on board beforehand.
    And I do want to try <a href="http://www.braid-game.com/">Braid</a>
    now. But threatening
    suicide over not finishing your video <a
        href="http://fezgame.com/">game</a>? That&rsquo;s an attitude to <a
        href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3w1_E1V46M">critique</a>, not
    celebrate. The Internet is creatively disrupting a lot more than how
    video games and films about video games and music inspired by video
    games are getting made.  In my view, we&rsquo;re poised to turn a big
    chunk of the <a href="https://www.gittip.com/">economy inside out</a>.
    Let&rsquo;s play video games, and then let&rsquo;s deepen the
    conversation. That&rsquo;s what I hope to contribute to at events like
    XOXO in the future.</p>
