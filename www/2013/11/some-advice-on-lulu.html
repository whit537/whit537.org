<p>I received the following in email, and asked if I could publish my
reply here so you can read it, too. :-) </p>

<blockquote>

  <p style="text-indent: 0;">Hi Chad,</p>

  <p>I came across your site and saw that you used Lulu to publish Gospels. The
  resulting book looks to be of very high quality.</p>

  <p>My wife and I live in New Zealand. We are interested in self publishing her
  book of short stories - perhaps 50 pages in length if it were printed on A5
  size paper or similar. We would ideally like to publish the book in two
  languages: English and Hebrew.</p>

  <p>I would really appreciate your thoughts on Lulu. This is something neither of
  us has done before. Hope you don't mind taking the time to answer them.</p>
  
  <ul>

    <li>What is the cost to publish?</li>

    <li>What format would you recommend we use? I was
    considering using LaTeX to produce a PDF or PostScript file.</li>

    <li>Is there a minimum print run? I understand Lulu enables you to sell both e-books and
    printed books.</li>

    <li>Does Lulu allow you to retain copyright and distribution
    rights, i.e., can you distribute your book elsewhere?</li>
  
    <li>How did you find the overall process?</li>

  </ul>
  
  <p>Thanks for any advice you can give us.</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 0; margin: 1em 0 2em 50%">
    Best regards,<br />
    Someone
  </p>

<p>I did use <a href="http://www.lulu.com/">Lulu</a> for the first versions of
<i><a href="http://www.logstown.com/the-gospels/">The Gospels</a></i>, yes.
The quality was good, though not exceptional (thin paper and no paper choices,
glue bindings instead of sewn-through for the hardback). I ended up getting a
short run of 100 from a proper book printer, <a
href="http://www.thomsonshore.com/">Thomson-Shore</a>, and the cost was 34%
lower: $6.19/ea vs. $9.36/ea. at Lulu for paperbacks (hardbacks were $18.86 at
Lulu). Lulu does have cost calculators on their site. There's no minimum print
run with Lulu, and as I recall the price did not go down significantly with
longer print runs. Basically, Lulu works for one-offs, which is a fine place to
start.</p>

<p>In terms of software, I found for both Lulu and Thomson-Shore that Adobe
Acrobat was a requirement. You're basically on your own if you deliver a PDF
produced in any other way than with Acrobat Distiller. Their first
trouble-shooting question is, &ldquo;Did you produce the file with
Distiller?&rdquo; and if you say, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; that's what they tell you
to do. Again, this can make sense for a one-off: worst-case you're out the ten
bucks or whatever. For anything more involved you should expect to invest in or
otherwise procure Acrobat. Of course, it's perfectly fine to produce a PDF with
LaTeX (I used <a href="http://www.princexml.com/">PrinceXML</a> for <i>The
Gospels</i>) and then run it through Distiller before delivering it to the
printer.</p>

<p>Lulu as I used them didn't touch on copyright (though the text of <i>The
  Gospels</i> is public domain anyway). I believe they offer additional
distribution services (like cross-listing on Amazon?) that might have further
legal implications, but I didn't use them for that. I just used them as an
on-demand printer, and as far as that went they were fine.</p>

<p>The other thing I'd say about Lulu is that I have no idea who ordered from
me. By doing my own fulfillment (using PayPal to collect payments) I have the
chance to interact over email with the people buying from me. The flip side is
that I still have 30 books on a shelf a year later, and I'm responsible for
shipping them. I bought a case of <a
href="http://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-5632/Bubble-Mailers/7-1-4-x-12-Self-Seal-Uline-White-Bubble-Mailers-1">bubble
mailers</a> (I called Uline and asked for samples of a few different options
before deciding on one). I address them by hand and mail them at the post
office, with a hand-drawn bookmark included. :-)</p>

<p>My biggest piece of advice to you is to go for it! It's a few hours work to
upload a PDF into Lulu and order a single copy for yourself for $10-20. Just do
it! There will be problems with it but that's a normal part of any process like
this. The first crepe is always terrible. The sooner you make those first
mistakes the sooner you'll iterate towards a product you're happy with.</p>

<p>Good luck! :-)</p>
