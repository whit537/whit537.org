<p>Three years ago, three friends and I started a philosophy reading group
called the Sewickley Area Philosophical Society (SAPS). Our first major project
was reading Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>.

</div>

<p>I had started the so-called &ldquo;first critique&rdquo; a year <a
    href="/2008/09/kant.html">prior</a> on my friend Jeremy Sanderson&rsquo;s
advice in response to a blog <a href="/2008/03/where-to-start.html">post</a>. I
also <a href="/2008/04/next-mereological-overlaps-and-kant.html">considered</a>
taking a Kant class from Stephen Engstrom at the University of Pittsburgh.
Well, I ended up taking (half of) a programming class <a
    href="/2008/08/im-student-again.html">instead</a>, but a few months ago I
chanced to get to know one of Engstrom&rsquo;s grad students, Tyke Nunez, and
he invited me to visit a grad seminar on Kant&rsquo;s <i>Critique of
    Judgement</i> given by visiting professor Andrew Chignell. It turns out
that Andrew graduated from Wheaton the year I arrived there, and I knew his
brother. Andrew was very gracious to let me visit his seminar.</p>

<p>Finally, then, after four years, I&rsquo;ve encountered two of Kant&rsquo;s
major critical works (along with a number of other books), and I&rsquo;ve had
an experience of academic philosophy. Honestly, it&rsquo;s not where I need to
be right now. I&rsquo;m not in a position to switch careers (family, mortgage,
momentum elsewhere), and visiting Andrew&rsquo;s class&mdash;for which
I&rsquo;m grateful&mdash;made it clear that my trying to participate as an
outsider is untenable.  I&rsquo;m too distant geographically and professionally
for it to make sense for me to continue to impose there. Instead, I&rsquo;ve
rejoined the SAPS after two years apart. I had stepped away after the first
critique; the group continued apace. My first book back is Alasdair
MacIntyre&rsquo;s <i>After Virtue</i>.</p>

<p>I would say that, philosophically, the past four years have been both
encouraging and humbling. I&rsquo;m still committed to the philosophy of <a
    href="http://whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">abstraction</a>,
but coming up with a personal, idiosyncratic language is one thing, and
establishing that language in the cultural consciousness is another. There was
an <a
    href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/11/03/abc-proof-too-tough-even-for-mathematicians/o9bja4kwPuXhDeDb2Ana2K/story.html">extreme
    example </a> of this recently, when a top mathematician emerged after two
decades of isolation with a solution to one of math&rsquo;s toughest problems;
it&rsquo;s so arcane that it will take years more for the rest of the math
community to even begin to understand it. I think abstraction has legs. Whether
it falls to me to bring it forth into the world remains to be seen. I console
myself that if it&rsquo;s essentially true, something like it is bound to come
to light eventually, one way or another.</p>

<p>I see myself a few years into an extended period of listening and learning
with regard to philosophy, during which I expect to continue doing much more
reading than writing. Writing is a lot of work, and my priority right now is
launching <a
    href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a>. Hopefully one day I&rsquo;ll
wake up and find that I&rsquo;ve got a solid foundation laid and a chance to do
something with it. Until then, discussions with SAPS and other friends and
occasional blog posts will suffice.</p>

<h2>So What Am I Thinking About?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about evolution. I&rsquo;m reading <i>The Selfish
    Gene</i> by Richard Dawkins. It&rsquo;s the book that launched his career
in the 70s. More recently he&rsquo;s become renowned for his atheism, and
he&rsquo;s been something of a bogeyman for me personally (see <a
    href="/2006/11/taking-edge-off-dawkins.html">here</a> and <a
    href="/2007/01/best-argument-for-god-weirdness.html">here</a>). He does
have a religious chip on his shoulder in <i>Selfish Gene</i>, clearer to see in
hindsight. I use the language of memes, which he coins at the end of this book,
so I&rsquo;m looking forward to reading that. So far he seems to be confused
about the difference between efficient and final causes, but we shall see.
Genetics itself is fascinating. Dawkins admits throughout that, this being a
popular-level book, his language is imprecise and metaphorical. This makes me
want to go deeper. How tight is the connection really between genes and
behavior? What does the math look like?  Evolution seems to me to be something
of a catch-all theory that totally encompasses the past by reference to the
present, but what does it say about the future? I have this brainstorm that
other sciences could be reformulated as limiting cases of evolution. Next stops
on this train are Lewontin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Units of Selection,&rdquo;
Dewey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Influence of Darwin on Philosophy,&rdquo; and
Darwin&rsquo;s <i>Origin of Species</i> itself.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking some about miracles, mostly because of Christmas.
Reading <i>The Selfish Gene</i> while celebrating the Virgin Birth had the
ironic effect of strengthening my faith in that particular miracle. I
don&rsquo;t think much of interventionist interpretations of the miraculous,
but I&rsquo;m fairly open to thinking that really weird stuff very
occassionally happens. Evolution actually depends on it: random mutation. The
two books on my radar here are those by C.S. Lewis and Craig Keener. But the
really interesting thing to me is the interplay between miracles and culture.
Nothing could be more dramatic and life-altering if experienced personally, and
yet using belief in miracles as a litmus test for group membership is so ...
fraught.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about the
    Gospels. I published <a href="http://www.logstown.com/the-gospels/">my own
        edition</a> so I could read them the way I wanted. Now to read them.
    :-) I&rsquo;m motivated here by the desire to teach my kids, so I&rsquo;d
    better get moving! I envision a curriculum characterized by a comprehensive
    analysis. I want to say to my kids things like, &ldquo;There are 26
    distinct miracles recorded in the Gospels, and 22 of them are healings. Can
    you name the other four?&rdquo; I made up those numbers, but you get the
    idea.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about Islam. I read a translation of the Koran a while
back, and now we&rsquo;ve gotten to know a couple from Saudi Arabia.
They&rsquo;re from Mecca, actually. It&rsquo;s fascinating to start to see the
world through their eyes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about emotion and morality. I&rsquo;m wondering about a
moral theory grounded in <i>following</i>. I&rsquo;m interested to grant that
value judgements are essentially subjective (contra MacIntyre, most
immediately), and then look at morality as allegiance. The things to tease out
here are the interplay between group and individual, and especially the way
that individuals lead and follow. This is deep and rich, and touches on many
things. I&rsquo;d like to revisit <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i> for
this. I also have a book on my shelf called <i>Self</i>, by Richard Sorabji; I
don&rsquo;t know if it directly relates here but I&rsquo;d like to get to it.
Certainly, besides ethics, there&rsquo;s whole fields of anthropology and
psychology and cultural criticism that could be fruitfully engaged with this
project in mind.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also still thinking about abstraction. There&rsquo;s a story to be
told about the early moderns, and how abstraction reconciles their divergent
metaphysics. Kant comes close, but the tentative story with Kant is how his
presuppositions, especially his philosophy of science and his logic, constrain
him. There are three books on Kant&rsquo;s table of judgments that would be the
next step for me there. I&rsquo;ve also been introduced by Martha Lindeman to
the field of cognitive psychology, which seems to be situated between
neuroscience and philosophy. I&rsquo;m eager to explore the body of work there
on category formation. I intuit that experimental philosophy, which is on the
edge of my radar, has things to say here as well.</p>

<p>I have one more chapter left in a symbolic logic workbook. I should get
around to <i>Parts</i> one of these days. I finished a first pass through
Plato&rsquo;s <i>Republic</i>, and, while I need to read his second critique,
I&rsquo;m far enough along with Kant that I&rsquo;m ready to hit some other big
names: Aristotle and Wittgenstein. I&rsquo;d also like to experience the
presocratics at the root of the Western tradition; Nietzsche and Hegel,
too.</p>

<p>But now I&rsquo;m really stealing time from Gittip, unfortunately, and I
have to go. I may not be posting much about philosophy this year, but
don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll be reading.</p>
