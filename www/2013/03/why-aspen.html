<div class="midbar"><em>I wrote a web framework called Aspen in 2006, and in
    2012 I built a site with it called Gittip. People looking at Gittip are <a
        href="https://twitter.com/zeeg/status/316440131601063937">wondering</a>
    what Aspen is all about, so I wrote this post to explain the history and
    the design philosophy of Aspen from my perspective.</em></div>

<p>Ah, the heady days of Python web programming in the early aughts! Everyone
had their own framework, with almost-forgotten names like Quixote, jonpy, and
Spyce. Ian Bicking looked at ten of them in a web framework <a
    href="http://ftp.ntua.gr/mirror/python/pycon/papers/framework/web.html">shootout</a>
at PyCon 2003. Back in those days Zope was the big player in the Python world,
along with its wild child Plone. Then we started hearing rumblings about a web
shop in Chicago with an attitude of its own and a killer project management
app. Ruby on Rails dropped in 2004. Django followed in 2005, and by the end of
2006 Guido himself had <a
    href="http://blog.gordaen.com/2008/04/03/guido-on-django-in-2006/">pronounced</a>
Django the winner of the Python web wars.</p>

<p>My own contribution came comparatively late, in early 2006. When I <a
    href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/chicago/2006-April/000655.html">presented</a>
at ChiPy in April, it was called httpy. By November, it was called <a
    href="http://aspen.io/">Aspen</a>.  Django was all the buzz at PyCon that
year. I button-holed Guido and pressed him to tell me why he thought raising
Response objects was a bad idea.
&ldquo;It violates the principle that you should return from only one
place,&rdquo; he managed, before excusing himself. &ldquo;I have to go. I don't
want to miss Adrian's talk about Django.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then web 2.0 happened.</p>

<p>Then social networking happened.</p>

<p>Then mobile happened.</p>

<p>The whole time I couldn't shake Aspen. Like a ball and chain, or a dog on my
ankle, I dragged it from one gig to the next. The Curse of Aspen.</p>

<p>Now here it is, 2013, and I've got this site called <a
    href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a> that is starting to see some
traction. Gittip is implemented in Aspen, and naturally people are <a
    href="https://twitter.com/zeeg/status/316440131601063937">scratching</a>
their heads. Why use this quirky also-ran instead of Rails or Django?</p>

<h2>Principles</h2>

<p>Aspen has a design based on principle, whereas Rails and Django inherited a
design pattern from the Java world that was never meant for web programming.
This makes programming with Aspen much more rational.</p>

<p>The two principles to Aspen's design are:</p>

<ol>
    <li>URLs map directly to the filesystem.</li>
    <li>Files are split into pages.</li>
</ol>

<p>Everything in Aspen's architecture flows from these two principles.</p>

<p>The first principle is what keeps Aspen close to <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">HTTP</a>. The path
is the primary mechanism for picking out a resource on an HTTP server, and,
clearly, the path used in HTTP is derived from the paths used on filesystems.
Therefore, using the filesystem for routing is the best way to go with the
grain of HTTP. All other routing mechanisms&mdash;pattern matching,
decorators, object traversal, etc.&mdash;all introduce friction between the
application and HTTP. Question: How do you do URL routing in Django? Answer:
Regular expressions. Now you've got, as they say, two problems. ;^)</p>

<p>Of course, non-filesystem-based routing mechanisms were developed for a
reason, and that reason is that CGI and PHP landed us in a morass of
unmaintainable spaghetti. By the late 1990s we were flailing, looking for
anything that remotely resembled order and sanity. &ldquo;HAS ANYONE EVER
ORGANIZED ANY SOURCE CODE EVER BEFORE EVER!?!?!?&rdquo; we cried. And Trygve
Reenskaug calmly replied, &ldquo;Sure, I invented this pattern called MVC at
PARC back in the late 1970s. It's for desktop GUIs, but maybe check it
out?&rdquo; So we did. Sun introduced its so-called <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_2">Model 2</a> architecture in
1998, and, in a 1999 article for JavaWorld.com entitled, &ldquo;<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_2">Understanding JavaServer Pages
    Model 2 architecture</a>,&rdquo; Govind Seshadri recognized it as an
implementation of MVC:</p>

<blockquote>

    In this article, I provide an in-depth look at how you can gain optimal
    separation of presentation from content by using the JSP Model 2
    architecture. This model can also be seen as a server-side implementation
    of the popular Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

</blockquote>

<p>The problem is that web servers are not desktop GUIs. Using MVC for
server-side web programming is, to be honest, a kludge. Yes, it looks sane
compared to spaghetti PHP, but that's not saying much. With Aspen I've tried to
design an application architecture that is native to web programming.</p>

<p>With Aspen, URLs map directly to files called &ldquo;simplates,&rdquo; and
these consist of one or more pages. In the simplest case, with one page, a
simplate is served as a static file. When you add another page at the top of
the file, then the first page is programming language syntax, and the second
page is templating language syntax that can use the names from the first page.
Simplates use the ASCII page break (<code>&#94;L</code>) for page breaks.</p>

<pre>
program = "Aspen"

&#94;L

Greetings, {&#123; program }}!
</pre>

<p>Aspen's second principle, that files are split into pages, is what saves
Aspen from the spaghetti mess of PHP. You can't arbitrarily mix code and
content. You can only have code in the first page, and only content in the
second page. Aspen brings code and content as close together as possible
<em>without</em> mixing them. It steers you toward well-architected apps,
without the friction that comes from fighting HTTP.</p>


<h3>Derivations</h3>

<p>The past seven years of use have demonstrated that Aspen's principled
approach works. From these two principles, we can derive all of the common use
cases of modern web development:</p>

<ul>

    <li>Any file without a page break is a static file.</li>

    <li>Any file with two pages is a &ldquo;rendered&rdquo; simplate. Page one
    is code, page two is templating. Different templating languages can be used
    for different simplates, even on the same site.</li>

    <li>A third page at the top of the file is code that is run once, the first
    time the page is hit.</li>

    <li>Files with extensions for serialization formats such as
    <code>.json</code> have no templating page, and serialization is done
    automatically.</li>

    <li>A file with no file extension is a &ldquo;negotiated&rdquo; simplate,
    and is capable of serving multiple content types (either through explicit
    HTTP content negotiation, or through implicit negotation based on file
    extension).</li>

    <li>Path parts beginning with <code>%</code> (percent) are
    parameterized.</li>

    <li>Files with names beginning with <code>%</code> and having no file
    extension are &ldquo;greedy&rdquo; simplates, and are used to serve any
    requests below the given path.</li>

    <li>Files with names ending in <code>.sock</code> are SocketIO
    endpoints.</li>

    <li>Models and business logic live in libraries, and are imported into
    simplates.</p>

    <li>Simplates lend themselves easily to having testing helpers written for
    them.</p>

</ul>

<p>The Aspen architecture is suited for a whole range of applications, from
short-lived static file servers, to service layers and internal dashboards, to
consumer-grade web applications. Furthermore, the Aspen architecture is
language-agnostic. Versions of Aspen exist (with varying maturity) for Go,
JavaScript, Ruby, and Python. There's no reason in principle that a single
server process couldn't serve simplates that use different programming
languages.</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>

<p>The biggest practical problem with simplates right now is tool support. Text
editors, linters, code coverage tools, and the like don't know about simplates
yet. We do have a <a
    href="https://github.com/gittip/aspen-vim">Vim mode</a>, but it's very
young. I don't use it, actually. I find myself manually calling <code>set
    filetype=html</code> in simplates to switch from Python to HTML syntax
highlighting. It might be necessary to <a
    href="https://github.com/gittip/aspen-python/issues/148">adopt</a> a
simplate-specific file extension to make it easier to write and configure
tools. Obviously the tool support is good enough that I and others are
productive with Aspen. You can drop into the Python debugger directly from
simplates, for example. If Node has shown us anything over the past few years,
it's that we can build fairly robust ecosystems pretty quickly if we want to.
Tool support for Aspen is occasionally a little frustrating, but I'm not too
worried about it in the long run.</p>

<p>The biggest strategic challenge to Aspen I see is <a
    href="http://meteor.com/">Meteor</a>. Aspen optimizes for HTTP, Meteor
abstracts away HTTP altogether. If Meteor falls short of its ambitious goal to
be the next UNIX, I expect it to be because HTTP is too leaky of an
abstraction. I'm also not sure that full-stack JavaScript will carry the day as
solidly as Meteor seems to require. Other languages aren't dead yet! We shall
see.</p>

<p>The current framework players aren't going anywhere soon either, of course.
What if Rails or Django added filesystem dispatch as an optional routing
mechanism?  That'd be a huge win, in my book. Aspen has already inspired one
new framework, <a href="https://github.com/dcrosta/keystone">Keystone</a>. If
the wider web programming community takes filesystem routing to heart in
whatever form, I'll chalk that up as a success. In the mean time I'm seeing
enough promise with Aspen on Gittip that I'm content to keep going with it.</p>


<h3>Future Directions</h3>

<p>So where is Aspen going? First, we're going to keep using it with Gittip. I
want Gittip to be for Aspen what Basecamp was for Rails and LJW was for Django.
If you want to see what a real Aspen app looks like, go look at <a
    href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com">the Gittip source</a>.
Maybe even clone it and send us a pull request. :)</p>

<p>Second, I really want to push Aspen in this multi-glot direction we've
started in on. The <a href="https://github.com/gittip/aspen-python">Python</a>
version is obviously the most mature. <a
    href="https://www.gittip.com/pjz/">Paul Jimenez</a> has been helping me run
that project for a couple years now. I started the Ruby and JavaScript ports
during my first Ruby and Node meetups a few months ago. The <a
    href="https://github.com/gittip/aspen-ruby">Ruby</a> version is still
waiting for the right person to come along and own it. The <a
    href="https://github.com/gittip/aspen-javascript">JavaScript</a> version
has seen greatly cleaned up by <a href="https://www.gittip.com/geNAZt/">Fabian
    Fa&#223;bender</a>, however, and the <a
    href="https://github.com/gittip/aspen-go">Go</a> port from <a
    href="https://www.gittip.com/meatballhat/">Dan Buch</a> is more than a bare
hack. What we really need to do is write up a language-agnostic definition of
Aspen, and then we can revisit the <a href="http://aspen.io/">aspen.io</a>
website and discuss each language implementation in context.</p>

<p>If you want to give Aspen a try, then your best bet is to download the
Python version from <a href="http://aspen.io/">aspen.io</a> (the other versions
aren't actually published there yet!) and go through the <a
    href="http://aspen.io/quick-start/">Quick Start</a>. If you want to
contact me or get involved with Aspen, the place to start is Twitter (<a
    href="https://twitter.com/whit537">@whit537</a>), or the <a
    href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=aspen">#aspen</a> channel on
Freenode.</p> <p>Thanks! :)</p>
