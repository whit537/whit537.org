<p>After five years, I ran a 5k again. This time it was at Brady's Run Park,
part of a benefit for the <a href="http://www.ohiorivertrail.org/">Ohio River
  Trail</a>. A much smaller field than the Applefest 5k, which is the only
other 5k I've done (<a href="/2007/10/run.html">one</a>, <a
  href="/2008/10/run.html">two</a>), I placed 10th at 25:47 (8:19).</p>

<p>Paul is now into trail running, and Kim is a <a
  href="http://www.fuelyourpassion.net/">professional triathlete</a>. She
recently qualified for Kona!</p>
