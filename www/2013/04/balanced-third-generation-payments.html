        <b>Full disclosure:</b> <a
            href="https://www.balancedpayments.com/">Balanced</a> is a <a
            href="/2012/12/why-i-love-balanced.html">key partner</a> for my
        business, <a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a>.</b>

    <br /><br />

    A while back I told Jareau Wade, Balanced co-founder in charge of business
    development, that I thought their real-time merchant underwriting was an
    underappreciated feature. Now he's asked me to say more about that.

</em></div>

<p>I see online payment processing as falling into two broad categories:
e-wallet and white-label. PayPal is the incumbent e-wallet, followed by Google
Checkout, Amazon Payments, etc. For this class of products the payment
processing brand is consumer-facing. For the white-label class of products, the
payment processing vendor is behind the scenes, and the merchant or marketplace
is the consumer-facing brand. There's also offline payment processing, where <a
    href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a> seems to be doing well, and of
course there's bitcoin, which for our purposes here is just another
currency.</p>

<p>I think of the growth of white-label payments in terms of three phases.</p>

<p><b>Phase I</b> was about offering online credit card processing <em>at
    all</em>.  Basically, this meant putting paper forms online. You still had
all the crap to deal with&mdash;the arcane fee structures, the negotiations,
the fine print, clunky or non-existent APIs and dashboards. It was better than
nothing, but it was begging to be optimized.  When I think of Phase I, I think
of <a
    href="http://www.authorize.net/">Authorize.net</a>.</p>

<p><b>Phase II</b> was about optimizing the developer experience for credit
card processing. Paul Graham <a
    href="http://www.paulgraham.com/schlep.html">points out</a> that the
inefficiences of Phase I were a business opportunity hiding in plain site, and
that <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> saw it. Stripe cut out all the
crap and offered a straight-forward fee structure with a gorgeous dashboard and
API, and they won Phase II. (Incidentally, YCombinator funded both Stripe and
Balanced, as well as <a href="https://wepay.com/">WePay</a>. Jareau has
suggested that YC host a royal rumble of sorts, and if you want to see that
like I do, you should add a +1 over on <a
    href="https://github.com/balanced/balanced.github.com/issues/22">this
    GitHub issue</a>.)</p>

<p>Now, as a personal aside, I spent the aughts not doing ecommerce. I built a
lot of websites but never got over the hump of inefficiency represented by the
Phase I processors.  I sort of woke up a year or two ago in a nice, comfy
corporate job, wondering what the heck had happened to all of my start-up
ambitions (easy answer: four kids and a mortgage, that's what!). I had heard
buzz around Phase II processors, and I decided to go back to basics and build
the minimum viable web business: a page where people could enter a dollar
amount and credit card info and it would deposit money in my bank account. It
worked.  I convinced a friend to give me a dollar through that site and that is
the first dollar I ever made on the web.</p>

</div>

<p>The vendor I used was a Phase II contender, <a
    href="https://feefighters.com/">FeeFighters</a>. They promised easy pricing
and they did have a nice dashboard and API as well as great support, but they
didn't hide the underlying merchant account well enough and I ended up getting
burned on fees. It actually got worse. My minimum viable business developed
into a personal finance app called IHasAMoney, which didn't really go anywhere,
but then I started Gittip, which did get some traction. By then FeeFighters had
gotten acquired by GroupOn and I got caught in <a
    href="http://blog.gittip.com/post/25565694263/how-not-to-get-acquired">acquisition
    hiccups</a>. Two weeks into Gittip I had to scramble to find another
vendor, and by then Stripe was the obvious choice. Unfortunately, a few weeks
after <em>that</em>, Stripe had to <a
    href="https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/issues/67#issuecomment-6553374">ask
    me to leave</a> because I was violating their terms of service. That's when
I started to realize that credit card processing is not the only piece of the
payments puzzle.</p>

<p><b>Phase III</b> takes credit card processing as a solved problem, and
pushes further. That's what <a
    href="https://www.balancedpayments.com/">Balanced</a> does. Stripe went
depth-first: they took one piece of the puzzle, credit card processing, and
totally nailed it. Balanced went breadth-first: they've spent a few years now
laying the foundation for a whole suite of payment processing products, and
it's starting to pay off. Yes, you can process credit cards on Balanced, with a
decent API and dashboard and pricing comparable to Stripe's. But you can also
do next-day and in some cases <a
    href="http://blog.balancedpayments.com/introducing-balanced-same-day-payouts-wells-fargo/">same-day
    bank transfers</a> in <a
    href="http://blog.balancedpayments.com/balanced-payment-method-pay-with-bank-ach/">both
    directions</a> with Balanced. You can also hold money in escrow with
Balanced, with free transfers to and from your own bank account. Stripe has
bolted on some marketplace features, but they don't compare: with Stripe it takes seven days for merchants to receive funds.</p>

<p>Real-time merchant underwriting is the really killer feature that Balanced
has that, as far as I'm aware, no-one else does. With Stripe (etc.) your users
have to sign up for a Stripe account on Stripe's website before you can move
money on their behalf.  Balanced makes this an API call. Balanced literally has
an API call for <a
    href="https://www.balancedpayments.com/docs/api?language=bash#underwriting-an-individual">Underwriting
    an Individual</a> and another one for <a
    href="https://www.balancedpayments.com/docs/api?language=bash#underwriting-a-business">Underwriting
    a Business</a>. I would be quite interested to learn of another payments
provider with parallel API calls. I double-checked <a
    href="https://stripe.com/docs/api">Stripe</a> and <a
    href="https://www.wepay.com/developer">WePay</a>, and I'm not seeing it if
it's there. What this means is that Balanced isn't just for merchants, it's
also for marketplaces. That opens up a whole new dimension in the payments
space.</p>

<div class="midbar">

</div>

<p>Yes, Stripe solved payments for merchants. Balanced picks up from there, and
goes on to solve payments for entire marketplaces. Dunno about you, but I'd
call that one heck of a <a
    href="http://www.paulgraham.com/schlep.html">schlep</a>. The schlep isn't
over, of course. For example, Balanced hasn't expanded beyond the United States
yet. You should add a +1 on <a
    href="https://github.com/balanced/balanced-api/issues/23">this GitHub
    issue</a> if that's something you want to see. And if you're doing a
startup in the U.S. and you're looking for a three-dimensional,
third-generation online payments provider, you should check out <a
