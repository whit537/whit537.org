So after <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/10/claims-of-allegiance.html">reading MacIntyre</a>, I really think I can use <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">scale</a> to reconcile Aristotle, Liberalism, and Christianity.* Christy, it would seem, <a href="http://www.christyanity.com/">agrees</a> with me. My wife does not. Or at least, she wishes that I would go about doing so in a "normal" way ... like, um, going to school. Reading on the bus doesn't count for some reason.<br /><br />Jessica: I love you, but ... <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2007/11/14/scisurf114.xml&amp;CMP=ILC-mostviewedbox">BLAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</a><br /><br />:^D<br /><br />Printed <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0770">it</a> out for the bus ride tomorrow.<br /><br /><hr /><br />* Christianity and Liberalism are easy: The basic justification for <a href="http://gkupsidedown.blogspot.com/2006/12/elephant-in-chancel.html#c2760779013443953462">Jesus, Paul and John</a> is, "God told me so." Preference. The force of personality. (See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Johannine-Polemic-Role-Tradition-Theology/dp/0891305793">also</a>.)<br /><br />And MacIntyre's Aristotle? Scale explains tradition really well: <span style="font-style: italic;">Traditions</span> are composed of <span style="font-style: italic;">persons</span>, and these interact with each other. So traditions do resolve into the force of personality ("preferences" in MacIntyre), but to rationally justify a course of action is precisely to fit that preference into a conceptual scheme that is larger than the preferring person. Traditions are necessarily in conflict because abstraction always forces one to emphasize certain low-level realities over others.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-5217427578540279599?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
