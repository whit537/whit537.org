I am pleased to tell you that     we have just rolled out a major update to <a href="http://www.acn-us.org/">our     website</a>, and I would like to call your attention to a few     highlights.</p>      <p>The most obvious change will be the new graphic design, which we have     been using in our email communications for a couple months now and are happy     to bring to our website. You will also notice immediately that we have moved     the parish map to the homepage. This is our most popular feature, so we     decided to, well, feature it.</p>      <p>More significantly though, we have reorganized the site to better     emphasize our mission: to build a <b>biblical</b>, <b>missionary</b>, and     <b>united</b> Anglicanism in North America. The new site provides three     levels of detail to help you keep track of our progress towards that     end:</p>      <ul><li><p>A revamped <i>About Us</i> section with <a href="http://www.acn-us.org/about/">helpful graphics</a> giving you the big       picture</p></li><li><p>A new <i>Milestones</i> section that tracks the <a href="http://www.acn-us.org/milestones/">high-level meetings and councils</a>       that move our work forward</p></li><li>The <i>News</i> section: day-to-day and week-to-week stories of       biblical, missionary, and united Anglicanism at <a href="http://www.acn-us.org/archive/">the grass roots</a></li></ul>      <p>I hope you find this breakdown useful for getting a handle on the work     God has given the Network to do. Our work is far from over, so we welcome     your continued financial support especially as we enter the holiday     giving season. We depend always on your prayers, feedback, and     involvement.</p>       <p>       With thanks also for your attention,<br /> <br />    <img src="http://www.acn-us.org/email/2007/11b/chad-sig.png" alt="Chad's signature" /><br /> <br />    <span style="font-size:78%;">         Chad W.
