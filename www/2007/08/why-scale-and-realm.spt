I <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">asked</a> you to tell me "where I'm sloppy and where I'm na&#xef;ve" regarding  <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">scale</a> and <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/realm.html">realm</a>, and over the past few months I've gotten a few folks to answer me, albeit offline. This feedback has helped me clarify my goal with this project.<br /><br />Back in June, I got to go over scale and realm with <a href="http://www.beren1hand.net/">Steve</a>. He introduced me to <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mereology/">mereology</a>, the branch of philosophy dealing with parts and wholes. I certainly ought to read up on that. I do remember convincing Steve that something I said was worthwhile, but not that something else was. Next time, may I record our conclusions right away.<br /><br />Also in June, I kicked around scale and realm with <a href="http://jack-out-of-the-box.blogspot.com/">Jack</a> and <a href="http://phoszoe.blogspot.com/">Geoff</a>. We considered that scale-and-realm is a subjective system and not an objective one. It is concerned with things in relation to each other rather than what exists in itself. That's basically fair.<br /><br />Then this past weekend <a href="http://www.ebryn.com/">Bryn</a> and I touched on realm. His point: by definition, our direct, conscious experience is only ever of mental objects, so why talk about anything else? To illustrate, I'm going to trot out <a href="http://static.whit537.org/2007/realms.jpg" target="_blank">this sketch showing our three realms</a> (it's from 1999; looks like I called them "worlds" then):<br /><br /><a href="http://static.whit537.org/2007/realms.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2007/realms.gif" alt="Man with brain; click to enlarge" /></a><br /><span style="font-size:78%;"><br />(Click to <a href="http://static.whit537.org/2007/realms.jpg" target="_blank">enlarge</a> in a new window.)</span><br /><br />Bryn is pointing out that the arrows all end up inside our brain, no matter where they start. For all we know, then, realm might just be a convention of conversation. Now firstly, I find the possibility of touching the physical and spiritual realms, however indirectly, to be more interesting than remaining isolated inside my head. And secondly, is there not a direct connection between realms in addition to the indirect, referential connection?<br /><br />I'm glad for these three different approaches, because pursuing them will round out the scale and realm picture. However, they also remind me that the data of philosophy admit of myriad abstractions, the choice of which is essentially pragmatic. As <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/02/bible-lightbulb-or-pickle.html">Prof. Agarwal puts it</a> with regard to electrical engineering (edited and abridged here):<br /><blockquote>Remember, we are engineers, our goal in life is to build interesting systems. So I can say "Look, Maxwell's equations [the basis of electrical engineering] are too hard. Let's make the assumption that all the systems that we will consider will have such-and-such-term in Maxwell's equations be zero.<br /><br />Someone will beat me up and say "Why? Why are you doing this?" And I'll say, "The world is arbitrary. I am an engineer. I want to build interesting systems. By making this simplification, I make my life simple. I am going to <span style="font-style: italic;">discipline</span> myself to only deal with those systems. Maxwell is turning around in his grave, but tough!"</blockquote>Abstraction is the trade-off of detail for power. In order to build a computer I <span style="font-style: italic;">have</span> to oversimplify Maxwell's equations. Such trade-offs, such choices, are arbitrary at the level of detail. They only have value within some higher-order system.<br /><br />So what higher-order goal do I have? I'm looking for tools to reconcile the Christian religion with experience, so that hopefully I can participate in life confidently as a Christian (the alternatives are to "lose my faith" or to "just sort of muddle along"). Scale makes sense of power struggles, economic injustice, the Sermon on the Mount, voter apathy, organized religion, schism, etc., etc., etc. Realm is the beginnings of a testable theory of the spiritual. Together they are my attempt to interpret Christianity for the modern world.<br /><br />Le&#015b;niewski may be turning in his grave, but tough.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-145447299053149166?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
