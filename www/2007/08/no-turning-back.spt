Those who <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> know me, know that I am <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> allergic to tomatoes. No, I don't immediately go into anaphylactic shock, I just get a huge rash around my mouth about a week later: not life-threatening, just <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> embarrassing. They called me Ronald McDonald in high school. (How can a kid not eat pizza?)<br /><br />Today Craig "Smokin' Santa" McClean, our parish's resident super-chef, changed my life in two ways. First, he very publicly gave me the nickname "Tomato Can." And then he introduced me to <a href="http://www.nomato.com/">Nomato</a>:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nomato.com/"><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2007/nomato.jpg" alt="Nomato brand tomato-less marinara sauce" /></a><br /><br />My life, indeed, will never be the same.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-6650899681175798407?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
