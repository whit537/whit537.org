<a href="http://desktop.google.com/">Google Desktop</a> updated itself today, and I like the improvements. Now if I hit <span style="font-family:courier new;">Ctrl</span> <ctrl>twice quickly, I get a pop-up search box:<br /><br /><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2007/gd-command-line.jpg" alt="Google Desktop Command Line" /><br /><br />This is a redux of the command line: a simple, text-based interface to everything on your computer, and the Internet besides. It's search, file and application launching all in one. </ctrl>As such, it's similar to both <a href="http://humanized.com/products/enso/launcher/quicksilver.php">Enso Launcher and Quicksilver</a>. I use Launcher at home, but I like Google's non-insistence on quasi-modes. I haven't used Quicksilver.<br /><ctrl><br />Once Google had my attention with this new feature, I took a look at their Widgets implementation:<br /><br /><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2007/gd-widgets.jpg" alt="Google Desktop Widgets" /><br /><br />I love the integration with Google Calendar, and I like the double-<span style="font-family:courier new;">Shift</span> knob (although it isn't always captured perfectly?). I'll have to keep an eye out for a widget I could build.<br /></ctrl><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-1353979523277310413?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
