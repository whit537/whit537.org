I've been absent from the Planet Python aggregators for a few months because I decided to combine my technical blog with my personal one (hence, URL change), and I also hit a <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/05/blam1.html">really busy</a> few months. Now I'm back in the mix, thanks to Andrew K., Ryan P., and a slightly calmer life.<br /><br />Most of my Python energy these days goes to <a href="http://www.zetadev.com/software/aspen/">Aspen</a>, which is a Python web server. I <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2006/11/announcing-aspen-wsgi-rific-web-server.html">released</a> Aspen 9 months ago today. I haven't done a release for 6 months, but that's because I've been too busy using it! I have, however, gotten great feedback from PyCon, the <a href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/web-sig">WSGI crowd</a>, and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/aspen-users/">Aspen's mailing list</a>, in addition to my own increasing experience with it. I think Aspen might be a keeper. I recently added something called <a href="http://aspen.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lib/python/aspen/handlers/simplates/">Simplates</a>, which I'm using for all my new web development, and yesterday we started working on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/aspen-users/browse_thread/thread/1c106d25edff621e">a connector for mod_wsgi</a>. I'll do another release when I can write tests, documentation, and marketing materials. Hopefully this fall; earlier if you chip in. :^)<br /><br />In the mean time, glad to be back. Happy hacking!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-4425211177366771461?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
