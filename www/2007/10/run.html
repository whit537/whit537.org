My wife Jessica and I ran the <a href="http://www.runhigh.com/2007%20Results/2007%20Results%20B/R100607AB.HTML">Applefest 5K</a> this morning. I came in 124th, and she came in 191st, out of 563. Her brother <a href="http://www.summerhousecoffee.com/">Aaron</a> came in 4th! I made the awesome move of thinking that the starting line was also the finish line. So I got my sprint on but then stopped 30 yards short of the finish. That was awesome. At least I still broke 24 minutes, which was my goal. It's kind of nice to be so uninterestingly average.<br /><br />In other news, looks like my old roommate and now building-mate <a href="http://www.klgates.com/professionals/detail.aspx?professional=1109">Paul</a> came in 6th and his wife Keira came in 695th out of 866 in the <a href="http://www.runhigh.com/2007%20Results/2007%20Results%20A/R082507AB.html">Run Around the Square</a> in August. Then last weekend, Jess's cousin Kim came in 12th out of 232 in the <a href="http://www.runhigh.com/2007%20Results/2007%20Results%20A/R092907CB.html">Autumn Leaf 5K</a>, while in the <a href="http://www.rungreatrace.com/">Great Race</a> 10K, Paul came in 118th, while Woody and Gussy (from church) placed 2453rd and 4874th, respectively, out of 5552 finishers.<br /><br />Yay team!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-6565064986459603129?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
