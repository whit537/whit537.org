<div>Oh man, I'm so pumped. In school I <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/02/robo-exegete.html">came</a> to the conviction that the way the Bible is divided into chapters and verses damages our ability to read it, because it imposes a structure on the text that masks the actual literary structure, wherein most of the meaning lies. I discovered the New English Bible and have used it since. Formated in one column, with chapter and verse numbers in the margins, it is basically <em>The Norton Anthology of Ancient Jewish and Early Christian Literature</em>. Unfortunately, the translation (which I do like) is a little too free to have caught on, and while there are plenty of used copies around, the NEB is out of print.<br /><br />Imagine my excitement, then, at discovering <a href="http://thebooksofthebible.info/main.php"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Books of the Bible</span></a>. These guys get it! Not only have they relegated chapter and verse numbers <a href="http://www.ibsdirect.com/pc-574-100-tniv-the-books-of-the-bible-paperback-bible-classic-black.aspx">all the way to the footer of the page</a> (they do have to be somewhere), they've even <a href="http://thebooksofthebible.info/pdf/OrderofTheBooks.pdf">gerrymandered the book ordering itself</a>! The New Testament is laid out in 4 streams, each starting with a Gospel: brilliant! And guess what translation they are using? The solidly popular TNIV, meaning that this edition has a chance to actually get picked up. Oh man, am I pumped. I ordered <a href="http://www.ibsdirect.com/pc-574-100-tniv-the-books-of-the-bible-paperback-bible-classic-black.aspx"><strike>a case</strike> two cases of 12</a>.<br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-4974887268806053752?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
