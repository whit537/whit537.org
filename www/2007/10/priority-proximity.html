[This is another attempt at <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/10/controversy.html">controversy</a>&mdash;ed.]<br /><br />In order to be a Christian, your decisions about where you live need to be made together with other families in your church. You are not a Christian if you don't live within walking distance of at least three families that you worship with on Sunday morning. Not a five minute drive. A one minute walk. Four families.<br /><br />Proximity is the Amish secret weapon. That's how they maintain community identity. That's how they keep their kids in the faith. When they move, they move by the <span style="font-style: italic;">community</span>, not by the family.<br /><br />Without proximity, you don't have chance face-to-face encounters with each other. Without chance encounters over many years, you don't build deep relationships. Without deep relationships, you're not in the family of God. And if you're not in the family of God, then you're not in the Church. And outside the Church there is no salvation. So, clearly, salvation means living within 60 walking seconds of three families that you worship with on Sunday.<br /><br />Step One is to get the people together. What's Step Two? I don't know! Let's find out!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-5273068375395983880?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
