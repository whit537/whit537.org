Over the past few years I've come to formulate a central problem in modern life like this: how does one adjudicate between competing claims of allegiance? PETA, the Pope, and Polo Ralph Lauren all want a piece of me; they all want me to buy into their vision of what life is all about. The number and force of these so-called <span style="font-style: italic;">claims of allegiance</span> constitute a huge source of tension in modern life.<br /><br />I don't know whence Alasdair MacIntyre's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whose-Justice-Which-Rationality/dp/0268019444"><span style="font-style: italic;">Whose Justice? Which Rationality?</span></a> entered my field of vision, but I finally picked it up from the library today (having finished <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/09/christianity-ether-or-magnetism.html">The Varieties</a> last week). And what do I find articulated on page 2 as the central question of the book?<br /><blockquote>How ought we to decide among the claims of rival and incompatible accounts of justice competing for our moral, social, and political allegiance?</blockquote>Folks, I am totally floored. Words! The same words, even! And he is about to give me 401 pages in answer to this very question! I am excited. Actually, after reading chapter one it looks like he is also going to "reunit[e] conviction [...] and rational enquiry" (7). In other words, he has Christianity's <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/09/christianitys-present-task.html">transition to Pluralism</a> well under way. Yay!<br /><br />Now, my hunch is that <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">scale, abstraction</a>, and <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/boundaries.html">boundaries</a> can help account for the diversity and conflict amongst traditions that MacIntyre identifies: the human person simply operates at a scale from which no final view can be gained of such societal-scale objects as justice and rationality. We shall see. Maybe after this I'll go to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Theology-of-the-Body/dp/0819873942"><span style="font-style: italic;">Theology of the Body</span></a> for the personalist angle.<br /><br />The juicier question is how to apply this stuff in the parish. We had a great conversation tonight <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/09/honesty-and-engagement.html">at church</a> about how allegiance to local communities is where the answer to the <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/09/answering-identity-crisis.html">identity crisis</a> (namely, MacIntyre's crisis of allegiance and conviction) lies. A viable account of salvation today must answer this crisis. Gathering at all was itself an act of allegiance, so we are on the right track.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-77615777208854865?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
