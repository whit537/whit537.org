We're shopping for a new bank account. I have a friend at <a href="http://www.pnc.com/">PNC</a>, I've heard generally positive things about them, and I like their website better than <a href="http://www.citizensbank.com/">the competition's</a>. However, here's my experience applying for a personal checking account. The funnel works great until the last step.<br /><br /><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2007/pnc/0.gif" /><br /><br /><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2007/pnc/1.gif" /><br /><br /><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2007/pnc/2.gif" /><br /><br /><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2007/pnc/3.gif" /><br /><br />As far as I can tell, <a href="http://www.apply.pnc.com/">www.apply.pnc.com</a> doesn't even have <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/dnsreport.ch?domain=www.apply.pnc.com">a DNS entry</a>! Ouch!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">UPDATE (Wednesday):</span> I got in touch with my friend, and he had their IT department fix the DNS issue. That was on Monday. However, since then the site still hasn't worked: now <a href="http://www.apply.pnc.com/">the connection times out</a>. I've notified them again. Wow, PNC.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">UPDATE UPDATE (Thursday)</span>: My bad!<br /><br /><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2007/pnc/4.gif" /><br /><br />I was trying <a href="http://www.apply.pnc.com/">http://www.apply.pnc.com/</a> and getting a timeout, but <a href="https://www.apply.pnc.com/">http<b>s</b>://www.apply.pnc.com/</a> works&mdash;note the <i>s</i>. (There's nothing at the root since they expect you to get there through one of <a href="https://www.pnc.com/webapp/unsec/Solutions.do?siteArea=/PNC/Home/Personal/Checking/Other+Checking+Products/Apply+Performance+Checking">their links</a>.)<br /><br />So it looks like PNC did in fact the problem promptly upon my contacting them. Yay!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-7369208681735801158?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
