<a href="http://www.acn-us.org/">Our</a> office is in the Henry W. Oliver Building. The <a href="http://www.pgh.anglican.org/">Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh</a>'s office is on the same floor, and Trinity Cathedral is right next door. The Diocese is cleaning the Cathedral <a href="http://www.celebrate250.org/">this summer</a> and restoring the graveyard, and Peter has posted <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/9167134@N03/sets/72157600421128897/">some great photos</a>. The shots of the upper part of the spire are from the Diocese's offices:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/9167134@N03/639395010/in/set-72157600421128897"><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2007/cathedral-before.jpg" alt="dirty cathedral spire" /></a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-554763129275248970?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
