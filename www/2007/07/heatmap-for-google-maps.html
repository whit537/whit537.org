<p><a href="http://www.acn-us.org/local/"><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2007/heatmap.jpg" alt="heatmap" title="heatmap" height="200" width="320" /></a></p><p>Today I rolled out <a href="http://www.acn-us.org/local/">a heatmap for our embedded Google Map</a>. Now I find <a href="http://www.fortiusone.com/">FortiusOne</a> doing the same via their <a href="http://www.geocommons.com/">GeoCommons</a> social network and <a href="http://www.geoiq.com/">GeoIQ</a> web service.</p><p>GeoIQ <a href="http://www.geocommons.com/javascripts/geoiq_google.js">uses</a> a straight <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/reference.html#GOverlay">GOverlay</a>, and I'm impressed at their performance, since they basically have to generate every single image every single time. I tried GOverlay, but opted for <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/reference.html#GTileLayerOverlay">GTileLayerOverlay</a>. This means I serve my heatmap in 256 x 256 chunks. I  generate a tile when it is actually requested, except for certain popular/expensive tiles, which I pre-generate. However, I only <span style="font-style: italic;">re</span>generate a tile when the data for that tile changes; otherwise it is served straight from the filesystem.</p><p>Since FortiusOne has already staked out the commercial space (I'm guessing their business model revolves around consulting and licensing for non-public/non-free implementations), perhaps I'll open-source my implementation. It would make a good show-piece for <a href="http://www.zetadev.com/software/aspen/">Aspen</a>. However, FortiusOne are clearly domain experts, and their (Rails-based) service is much further along. So does the world want an open-source, Python-based heatmapper? And moreover, do I want to support it?</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-1616284234444018255?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
