Here's my recipe: take any catholic branch of the Church (Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, Lutheranism?, etc.?), and start a parish with these properties:<br /><ul><li>The members of the parish all live within a five mile radius.</li><li>The parish only worships in the homes of its members.</li><li>Worship is normally a so-called "<a href="http://www.episcopalchurch.org/19625_14161_ENG_HTM.htm">deacon's mass</a>."</li><li>Worship is moderately traditional.</li><li>The parish makes all decisions by consensus.<br /></li><li>Otherwise, it participates fully within its jurisdiction.</li></ul>Voila! New Order Amish! Crazy enough that it just might work.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Variation:</span> For New Order Gypsies, everyone should live in hot air balloons instead of within five miles of each other.<br /><br />P.S. Thanks and props to the folks who came out to the Lloyd's today!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-7029913391161029697?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
