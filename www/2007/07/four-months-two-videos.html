The Network's Annual Council meets today and tomorrow in Texas. Our Moderator, Bishop Duncan, featured <a href="http://www.acn-us.org/documents/council-2007/address.html">two videos in his address</a> this morning. The first was produced on a moment's notice for use over Easter weekend, though our original plan for it was scrapped. The second was produced last week as part of an effort to gain clarity about the mission of the Network. It makes me pretty happy that these are <a href="http://www.acn-us.org/documents/council-2007/address.html">both now public</a>. BLAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-1872046802407230714?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
