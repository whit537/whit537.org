<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/07/20.html">Joel Spolsky</a> and <a href="http://www.scripting.com/2007/01/01.html#theUneditedVoiceOfAPerson">Dave Winer</a> think you shouldn't accept comments on your blog, and I agree with them. I haven't had a blog popular enough for this to be a problem, but I just <a href="http://www.stephenswitness.com/">set one up</a> that's likely to get more traffic. We restricted comment posting to author-only, and renamed "Comments" to "Follow-ups". So the idea is that people respond by email, and the author digests the feedback and uses Blogger's commenting mechanism to post his own follow-ups. <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a> does something similar: no comments, only email and trackbacks. Follow-ups happen in new posts.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-3795280400902709537?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
