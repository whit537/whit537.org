A couple months ago <a href="http://tech.whit537.org/2006/10/jitterbug-more-expensive-no.html">I looked into getting a Jitterbug cell phone</a>, but concluded that it would cost too much and I didn't want to loose my number. Well, circumstances have conspired to force me into a brand new cell phone plan with <span style="font-style: italic;">someone</span> (long story), and I decided this morning to go for the Jitterbug. So I called to place an order. Just to be sure, I asked whether I could indeed buy another annual plan before a year was up, but this time they said no! Oops.<br /><br />I'll go through the 3600 minutes from the Jitterbug annual plan in about 9 months. After that, it's $0.25 per minute. That puts me at about $73 per month for service, plus the initial $190 outlay. I wonder what Verizon can give me for that?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-5809474771848955527?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
