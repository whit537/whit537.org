Ok, back with some more code. This time it's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dewey/">Dewey</a>, a Python API and CLI for indexing and searching your filesystem. I'm not doing a full release yet, but I have tagged <a href="http://dewey.googlecode.com/svn/tags/0.3/">an 0.3 snapshot</a>, and if you're interested you can check out <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dewey/wiki/QuickStart">the Quick Start</a> and, of course, <a href="http://dewey.googlecode.com/svn/">the source</a>.<br /><br />This project represents the culmination of <a href="/2006/12/talking-to-subversion-from-python.html">some ideas</a> I've had percolating since last PyCon and earlier. Zope gives you a next-generation filesystem: extensible, transactional, searchable, etc. That's great, but it's too disconnected from the traditional filesystem. I expect the combination of Dewey for index/search plus Subversion for extensibility and ACIDity to make the traditional filesystem more competitive with RDBMSes.<br /><br />[<a href="/2006/10/my-name-is-chad-and-i-have-nih.html">NIH</a>: I started out this project with <a href="/2006/12/nih-roundup-epi-jinja-pasteprofile.html">a pretty good NIH score</a>, but I ended up using ideas rather than code from ExtendedPathIndex and ZCatalog. I am most certainly using ZODB, however. (Jinja and paste don't apply here.)]<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-2461415259726015759?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
