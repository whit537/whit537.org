When I <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/chicago/2006-April/000658.html">spoke at ChiPy</a> last spring, I shared the spotlight with Atul Varna. Yesterday Atul's company, <a href="http://www.humanized.com/">Humanized</a>, launched their product suite, <a href="http://www.humanized.com/products/">Enso</a>. These guys are unique for a few reasons. First, they are a software company, but their product isn't web-based. Second, they are <a href="http://www.humanized.com/about/">young and brilliant</a>, but aren't backed by <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/">Paul Graham</a>.<br /><br />More importantly, though, Enso is the fruit of work started by legendary interface designer <a href="http://jef.raskincenter.org/home/index.html">Jef Raskin</a>. Jef invented the Macintosh, and until his <a href="http://www.raskincenter.org/pressrelease.html">untimely passing</a> was working on a project called <a href="http://rchi.raskincenter.org/index.php?title=Archy_FAQ">Archy</a>, based on his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201379376/"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Humane Interface</span></a>. Jef's son Aza carries on his father's legacy at Humanized, and I imagine <a href="http://www.humanized.com/weblog/2007/01/24/enso_released_in_memory_of_jef_raskin/">this launch</a> carries no small amount of pride and emotion for Aza in particular. Congratulations of the first order to Aza, Atul & Co.!<br /><br />I've actually been part of Enso's beta program, and I can tell you that it's become a regular part of my workflow. I use <a href="http://www.humanized.com/products/enso/launcher/">Enso Launcher</a>'s <span style="font-style: italic;">open </span>command all the time (although I don't use <span style="font-style: italic;">go</span> as much, preferring an <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/">Expos&eacute;</a> <a href="http://www.anthasoft.com/usa/products/bounce/index.html">knock-off</a>). And now that <a href="http://www.humanized.com/products/enso/words/">spellcheck</a> works with dual monitors again, I'm starting to appreciate it too. The product is indeed humane, the implementation is rock solid, the packaging is slick, and I expect that this is just the beginning.<br /><br />And oh yeah, it's <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/chicago/2006-March/000593.html">written</a> <a href="http://www.evilbrainjono.net/cgi-bin/blog/showblog.cgi?permalink=291">in</a> <a href="http://www.humanized.com/ProcessManager/">Python</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-5222822523275259516?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
