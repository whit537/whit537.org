Some people say Richard <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Dawkins</span> will become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_God_Go_XII">the God of Atheism</a>. I say it's Scott Adams.<br /><br />Now, as you <a href="http://life.whit537.org/2006/11/too-ignorant-for-atheism.html">may know</a>, I read Scott's blog (he's the <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilbert</span> guy, remember?). A couple months ago, I posted <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/11/the_little_robo.html#comment-26244961">a comment</a> on one of his atheistic posts. Every day he gets thousands of comments, and who knows how many emails. There's no way he reads them all, although I think he at least skims: he'll mention the comments in a post, or leave comment replies himself.<br /><br />But I <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span> that he read my comment. How? He specifically made fun of me on his blog. Go look at <a href="http://www.pugnax.org/">how my blog looked</a> when he would have seen it. And now read his <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/12/acting_smarter_.html">very next post</a>. Did you catch the clincher?<br /><blockquote>Oh, and add &ldquo;gourmand&rdquo; to [the list of words to use if you want to appear smarter than you are].</blockquote>Clearly, I've gotten his attention. But it could be coincidence, right? To test my hypothesis, I sent him an email a few days ago:<br /><blockquote>I have a question that I think points up the limits of science  and opens the door to belief in the supernatural:<blockquote>Why are we in a deterministic system?</blockquote>Why is this stupid? </blockquote>And wouldn't you know it, his <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/01/irrational_athe.html">very next post</a> is clearly intended as a response. The clincher, again, is in the last paragraph:<br /><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">My</span> question is this: ... [emphasis mine]<br /></blockquote><span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Hah</span>! Now some of you might advise me to <a href="http://www.freenewmexican.com/news/36651.html">get a restraining order</a> against Scott for teasing my like this. But you know what? I'm used to it, because it's exactly like prayer: lob some petitions upwards, and divine the replies in the chicken-scratch of life. We all know that Scott likes to play <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/11/who_cant_be_hyp.html">mind games</a>, and apparently he's pretty good at answering prayer in a way that requires true faith to discern.<br /><br />So there you have it. From now on I'm going to <a href="mailto:scottadams@aol.com">pray to Scott Adams</a> whenever I have hard questions about Atheism.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-3011203027193449348?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
