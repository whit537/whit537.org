After four months of blogging (and some prodding from <a href="http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/">Grig</a>), I've joined <a href="http://planet.python.org/">Planet Python</a>. Besides waiting for blogging to become a regular habit, I was also waiting for Blogger to roll out custom domains, which <a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/2007/01/blogger-custom-domains.html">they did last week</a>. I had been using <a href="http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=41438&topic=8917">SFTP publishing</a>, but you only get <a href="http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=53336&amp;topic=10275">label-specific feeds</a> if Blogger hosts for you. And I didn't want to <a href="http://tech.whit537.org/search?q=jitterbug">spam you</a>.<br /><br />Now, by way of introduction: I'm Chad Whitacre, and I'm a freelance web developer in Pittsburgh. I used to work a lot with Zope and Plone. Then after a year trying to reinvent WSGI, I went into <a href="http://tech.whit537.org/2006/10/my-name-is-chad-and-i-have-nih.html">rehab for NIH Syndrome</a>. Now I'm building a WSGI-centric webserver called <a href="http://www.zetadev.com/software/aspen/">Aspen</a>. Also creeping onto the radar is <a href="http://tech.whit537.org/2007/01/dewey-think-google-desktop-for-python.html">Dewey</a>, which is basically the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=zcatalog">ZCatalog </a>for your filesystem. Jump in if you're interested!<br /><br />Look for me if you're going to PyCon. I'm on the <a href="http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/TestingToolsPanel">Testing Tools Panel</a>, and may do an Open Space Talk on Aspen or Dewey. In the mean time, thank you for reading, thanks to Planet Python for the add, and thanks to Grig for the prodding.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-6074044734719762986?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
