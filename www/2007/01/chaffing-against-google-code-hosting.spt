Google Code's issue tracker isn't the greatest. First, it doesn't put me in control of notifications. I can't specify an alternate email address, and I'm not even sure what events trigger notifications. Second, the issues listing is brittle: when I configure the listing (change columns, etc.), leave, and come back, my changes to the layout are lost. I also can't batch-edit on the list view. Better than <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">SourceForge</span>, worse than <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">FogBugz</span>. And granted, it's still a young project.<br /><br />On the plus side, Google Code Hosting has the absolute best customer service of any Google product. I have limited experience with the paid services (AdWords, appliances), but the customer service for their "free" services is <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Gmail-Problem-solving/tree/browse_frm/thread/13c1522f405438c6/d54960b5392ea09f#doc_514406f9d7560596"><span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">atrocious</span></a>. Happily, the folks running Google Code--Greg Stein, Ben <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Collins-Sussman</span>, Brian Fitzpatrick, etc.--have tons of Open Source street cred and know how to run a community. Which is to say that I should probably post all this on <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/google-code-hosting">the mailing list</a> instead of here. :-)<br /><br /><b>Update:</b> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=61">Filed</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=62">bug</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=63">reports</a>, and <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/google-code-hosting/browse_frm/thread/1dbe5984c210ebda">hit the list</a>.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</span> Figured out notifications: filter for codesite-noreply@google.com.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-5298210120382913109?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
