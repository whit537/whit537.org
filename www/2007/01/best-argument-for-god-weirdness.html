<p>Sometimes <a href="http://www.edge.org/">Brockman & Co.</a> get me down
about religion. But you know what? The Universe <b>MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO
    SENSE</b>. I mean: <i>why are we here?!</i> So what if we understand so
much about the Universe? <i>Why is there a Universe?</i> What&rsquo;s
<i>outside</i> the Universe? What the heck is time? What&rsquo;s <i>outside</i>
of time?  If there is nothing outside of space and time, then <b><i>what the
        heck does that
        mean?!</i></b></p>

<p>These are the questions that hit you circa 3rd grade. But you know what?
Turns out <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=outside+the+universe">no-one
    has <b><i>any idea</i></b></a>. You can&rsquo;t tell me that God is a bad
answer.</p>

<p>I started this blog under a <a href="http://www.pugnax.org/">pseudonym</a>,
but it&rsquo;s time to come out. I&rsquo;m a Christian, and I&rsquo;m no longer
ashamed, because Dawkins and Harris don&rsquo;t in fact have a better
answer.</p>
