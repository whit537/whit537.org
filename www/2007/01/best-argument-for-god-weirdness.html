Sometimes <a href="http://www.edge.org/">Brockman & Co.</a> get me down about religion. But you know what? The Universe  <span style="font-weight: bold;">MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE</span>. I mean: <span style="font-style: italic;">why are we here?!</span> So what if we understand so much about the Universe? <span style="font-style: italic;">Why is there a Universe?</span> What's <span style="font-style: italic;">outside</span> the Universe? What the heck is time? What's <span style="font-style: italic;">outside</span> of time? If there is nothing outside of space and time, then <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">what the heck does that mean?!</span><br /><br />These are the questions that hit you circa 3rd grade. But you know what? Turns out <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=outside+the+universe">no-one has <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">any idea</span></a>. You can't tell me that God is a bad answer.<br /><br />I started this blog under a <a href="http://www.pugnax.org/">pseudonym</a>, but it's time to come out. I'm a Christian, and I'm no longer ashamed, because Dawkins and Harris don't in fact have a better answer.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-4498632987757921439?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
