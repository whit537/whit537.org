After three months at <a href="http://www.acn-us.org/">my new job</a>, I finally have something to show for it: three <a href="http://www.acn-us.org/archive/2007/06/network-launches-three-new-ministry-initiative-websites.html">new websites</a>!<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.acn-us.org/">Network</a> is thick with politics, both internal and external. Some of the politics are ugly, some are fine. Watching it all is deeply fascinating, and I finally get why <a href="http://www.wheaton.edu/polsci/faculty/woodiwiss.html">Woodiwiss</a> and <a href="http://www.divinity.duke.edu/portal_memberdata/shauerwas">Hauerwas</a> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);font-size:78%;" >[geek note: Plone site!]</span> kept talking about the Church as <span style="font-style: italic;">political</span>, as concerned with <span style="font-style: italic;">power</span>.<br /><br />Human associations are <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">abstractions</a>, and the purpose of abstraction is always the magnification of power: we associate to accomplish things we never could alone. As <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">constituent objects</a> of these abstractions, humans wield greater or lesser power depending on their function. Association brings certain <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">properties</a> of the individual person to the fore--our capacities for cooperation, persuasion, competition, greed, coercion, malice, etc.--while our individual identity is <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">necessarily</a> lost. Briefly, then, our <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">scale language</a> opens up a whole range of questions for politics/ecclesiology, surely the most central of which is how the inter-personal ethic of the Sermon on the Mount applies on any larger-than-personal scale.<br /><br />That's a teaser on applying <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">scale language</a>. The immediate upshot for my work is that because our main website carries so much political freight, we've decided to focus for the time being on a series of stand-alone websites. The three we just launched are for <a href="http://www.anglican-church-planting.org/">church planting</a>, <a href="http://www.anglican-church-planting.org/">evangelism</a>, and <a href="http://www.anglican-church-planting.org/">missions</a>--three of our five so-called "ministry initiatives." <a href="mailto:chad@acn-us.org">Let me know</a> what you think!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-2222704462707466073?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
