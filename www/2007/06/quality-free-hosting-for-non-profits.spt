If you are a webmaster working with non-profits, you need to know about <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/index.php/Non-profit_Discount">DreamHost's free hosting offer</a>. <a href="http://www.acn-us.org/">We</a> signed up for one of these accounts, and it's great! We still have a <a href="http://www.johncompanies.com/">John Companies</a> jail for heavier Python apps (JC is absolutely rock-solid), but DreamHost is great for commodity hosting. If they ever support mod_wsgi, I'll be even happier.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-2719087716017393071?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
