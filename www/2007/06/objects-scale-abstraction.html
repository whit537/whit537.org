<p>This is a big post for me, because it articulates the basis of my amateur practical philosophy. I've been working on this since 1999. I'm particularly interested to <a href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">learn from you</a> where I'm sloppy and where I'm na&#xef;ve, but without further ado ...</p><p>Let an <span style="font-weight: bold;">object</span> be <span style="font-style: italic;">a thing, an entity</span>, and let a <span style="font-weight: bold;">property</span> be <span style="font-style: italic;">a characteristic of an object</span>. Objects are composed of other objects, and require certain properties of their constituent objects in order to exhibit their own properties.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scale</span> is a property, and it is <span style="font-style: italic;">the size of an object relative to a given frame</span>, where a <span style="font-weight: bold;">frame</span> is <span style="font-style: italic;">an arbitrarily bounded hierarchy of objects</span>. For example, here are a few objects in a frame, listed in order of scale, decreasing:<br /><ul><li>country club</li><li>golf course</li><li>hole</li><li>putting green</li><li>blade of grass  </li></ul>Each object has a relative size within the frame bounded by "country club" and "blade of grass." Each lower-order object is a constituent member of the next-higher object, forming a hierarchy.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstraction</span> is <span style="font-style: italic;">the process of fitting an object into a higher-order object</span>. Abstraction always entails a loss of information (nuance, subtlety, detail, complexity), and a gain in simplicity and usefulness. The putting green may be crafted by so-and-so, contoured thus-and-such, with a certain variety of grass or another, of a particular hue, in soil that is some part sand, clay, and organic matter, and which absorbs water at such-and-such a rate. However, these details of the green only matter <span style="font-style: italic;">within the hole</span> insofar as they affect the properties the hole <span style="font-style: italic;">actually requires</span> of the green: that it be smooth, that it be located at the far end, that it have a cup, etc. An abstraction, then, is a summary, an abbreviation, a short-hand, an objectification, and it serves the purposes of the higher-scale object.</p><p>I mean &ldquo;object&rdquo; in the most generic sense: a putting green, a government policy, a business decision, an ecological system, a value system, a religious practice. Therefore, these few simple terms enable an analysis that applies quite broadly. Given an object:<ul><li>What properties does the object  have?</li><li>What higher-scale objects  does/could it contribute to?</li><li>How do its properties relate to  each higher-scale object?</li><li>How does contributing to each  higher-scale object change the object over time?</li><li>What objects compose the object?</li><li>How do its constituents'  properties relate to its properties?</li><li>How would changing its constituents  change the object?</li><li>How  does the object change its constituents over time?</li></ul><a href="http://cag.csail.mit.edu/%7Eagarwal/">Prof. Anant Agarwal</a>'s lecture entitled "<a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/02/bible-lightbulb-or-pickle.html">Introduction and Lumped Circuit Abstraction</a>" is the most directly related discussion of these themes that I've found. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory">Systems theory</a> also appears to be related, though afaict it has more to do with the internal workings of a system (read: object) at a given scale, rather than patterns across scales. Certainly I'm skirting the edges of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology">ontology</a>. I've got plenty more BS as above, but <a href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">where do you think</a> I should go from here?</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-2374439917034375601?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
