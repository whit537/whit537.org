<p>This is a big post for me, because it articulates the basis of my amateur
practical philosophy. I&rsquo;ve been working on this since 1999. I&rsquo;m
particularly interested to <a href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">learn from you</a>
where I&rsquo;m sloppy and where I&rsquo;m na&#xef;ve, but without further ado
...</p><p>Let an <b>object</b> be <i>a thing, an entity</i>, and let a
<b>property</b> be <i>a
    characteristic of an object</i>. Objects are composed of other objects, and
require certain properties of their constituent objects in order to exhibit
their own properties.</p>

<p><b>Scale</b> is a property, and it is <i>the size of an object
    relative to a given frame</i>, where a <b>frame</b> is <i>an arbitrarily
    bounded hierarchy of objects</i>. For example, here are a few objects in a
frame, listed in order of scale, decreasing:</p>

<ul>
    
    <li>country club</li>
    
    <li>golf course</li>
    
    <li>hole</li>
    
    <li>putting green</li>
    
    <li>blade of grass</li>

</ul>

<p>Each object has a relative size within the frame bounded by &ldquo;country
club&rdquo; and &ldquo;blade of grass.&rdquo; Each lower-order object is a
constituent member of the next-higher object, forming a hierarchy.</p>

<p><b>Abstraction</b> is <i>the process of fitting an object into a
    higher-order object</i>. Abstraction always entails a loss of information
(nuance, subtlety, detail, complexity), and a gain in simplicity and
usefulness. The putting green may be crafted by so-and-so, contoured
thus-and-such, with a certain variety of grass or another, of a particular hue,
in soil that is some part sand, clay, and organic matter, and which absorbs
water at such-and-such a rate. However, these details of the green only matter
<i>within the hole</i> insofar as they affect the properties the hole
<i>actually requires</i> of the green: that it be smooth, that it be located at
the far end, that it have a cup, etc.  An abstraction, then, is a summary, an
abbreviation, a short-hand, an objectification, and it serves the purposes of
the higher-scale object.</p>

<p>I mean &ldquo;object&rdquo; in the most generic sense: a putting green, a
government policy, a business decision, an ecological system, a value system, a
religious practice. Therefore, these few simple terms enable an analysis that
applies quite broadly. Given an object:</p>

<ul>
    
    <li>What properties does the object
    have?</li>
    
    <li>What higher-scale objects  does/could it contribute
    to?</li>
    
    <li>How do its properties relate to  each higher-scale
    object?</li>
    
    <li>How does contributing to each  higher-scale object change
    the object over time?</li>
    
    <li>What objects compose the object?</li>
    
    <li>How do its constituents&rsquo; properties relate to its
    properties?</li>
    
    <li>How would changing its constituents  change the
    object?</li>
    
    <li>How  does the object change its constituents over
    time?</li>
    
</ul>
    
<p><a href="http://cag.csail.mit.edu/%7Eagarwal/">Prof. Anant
    Agarwal</a>&rsquo;s lecture entitled &ldquo;<a
    href="/2007/02/bible-lightbulb-or-pickle.html">Introduction and Lumped
    Circuit Abstraction</a>&rdquo; is the most directly related discussion of
these themes that I&rsquo;ve found. <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory">Systems theory</a> also
appears to be related, though afaict it has more to do with the internal
workings of a system (read: object) at a given scale, rather than patterns
across scales. Certainly I&rsquo;m skirting the edges of <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology">ontology</a>. I&rsquo;ve got
plenty more BS as above, but <a href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">where do you
    think</a> I should go from here?</p>
