WOW.<br /><ul><li>March 1: new <a href="http://www.acn-us.org/">job</a>.</li><li>April 11: new <a href="http://whit537.org/samuel.jpg">kid</a>.</li><li>June 15: finish <a href="http://tech2.whit537.org/2007/NT701.pdf">class</a> <span style="font-size:78%;">[PDF]</span>.<br /></li><li>June 30: close <a href="http://www.zetaweb.com/">Zeta</a>.</li></ul>Kid is awesome, job is insane (I have even more projects than before), class is going really well (took an incomplete, but got to start some neat software), and Zeta ... will actually exist as a shell for at least another year.<br /><br />The important thing here is that since tech and life have coalesced with this new job, I am likewise combining my tech and life blogs.
