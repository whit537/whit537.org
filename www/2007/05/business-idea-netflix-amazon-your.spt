Pittsburgh's Carnegie Library system lets you order books online and have them delivered to the branch of your choice. It emails you when they arrive there, you pick them up, and then drop them off at whatever branch when you're done. This changes the library experience pretty radically, since you're not spending lots of time browsing the collection.<br /><br />This is only a step or two removed from both Netflix and Amazon. Netflix does lending, Amazon does books; both do recommendations. Since libraries are usually public institutions, you might not be able to fly this solely for-profit direct-to-consumer. But maybe you could sell your infrastructure wholesale to the Carnegie Libraries of the world.<br /><br />GO, GO, GO!!!!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-8116168366511278903?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
