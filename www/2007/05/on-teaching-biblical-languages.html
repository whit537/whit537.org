I was frustrated in college that they taught us to read Greek but not to write or speak it (we actually did do composition in first-year Hebrew): learning just enough to write a sermon is an ugly short-cut. So I compiled an English-Greek dictionary, and wrote a paper for Volleyball class in biblical Greek (both now <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">bitrotting</span>). The Greek was terrible, but the paper actually made sense. The next year they finally offered Greek composition, but by then <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/02/robo-exegete.html"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">senioritis</span></a> had set in.<br /><br />Some professors now use the modern pronunciation, which is a great start. I spent the summer after senior year in Greece and Israel. I picked up a modern Greek grammar in Athens and currently attempt a book-learnt modern pronunciation. Had <a href="http://www.biblicalulpan.org/">Randall <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Buth's</span> program</a> existed (did it?), I probably would have preferred it to <a href="http://www.wheaton.edu/Theology/activities/holylands.html"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Wheaton's</span></a>. I hear that <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">Buth</span>, upon learning that a scholar he's just met at <a href="http://www.sbl-site.org/"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">SBL</span></a> teaches Greek, launches into conversation in Greek. I fantasize about replying.<br /><br />If I taught biblical languages, I'd use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lift-the-Flap-Bible/dp/1575844036">kids' bible</a> for composition exercises: simple grammar, basically the same vocab, and pictures for reinforcement. Win, win, win! Second, third, and fourth year, I'd <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bible-in-Pictures-for-Little-Eyes/dp/0802405959">step</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Egermeiers-Bible-Story-Book/dp/0871620065">things</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-News-Bible/dp/1585160814">up</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-4052498254381209295?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
