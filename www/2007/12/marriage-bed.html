In surfing things <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/12/virtual-worship.html">slangcath</a>, I ran across a progressive Anglican ordinand <a href="http://www.p2ptrust.org/blog/2007/07/polyamory-polygamy-and-polyandry-friend.html">wrestling</a> with <a href="http://voicetrembles.blogspot.com/2007/07/aftermath-and-explanations.html">polyamory</a>. It's new to him, and he doesn't know what to do with it. Folks, if you think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/After-Ball-America/dp/0452264987">the train</a> stops at gay marriage, <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/10/controversy.html">open your eyes</a>.<br /><br />This morning I was introduced to <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/richardson/fathers.x.i.ii.html">a moving passage</a> from the second century, where one Roman official writes to another of the Christians, saying (among many other things), "They share their board with each other, but not their marriage bed."
