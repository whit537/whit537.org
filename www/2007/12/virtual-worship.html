I attended my first virtual worship service today. It was an evening prayer service (GMT) in the <a href="http://slangcath.wordpress.com/">Anglican Cathedral</a> in <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>. I am fairly comfortable with online community from my open source experience, but this is a notch above. I had a nice chat with the worship leader after the service. The question of virtual sacraments is, um, a big one. But <a href="http://www.kendallharmon.net/t19/index.php/t19/article/4925/#91434">apparently</a> Lambeth is already addressing the issue through the <a href="http://www.ecclawsoc.org.uk/">Ecclesiastical Law Society</a>. So, um, yeah ... we'll see how that goes ...<br /><br />Here's a screenshot:<br /><br /><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2007/slangcath.jpg" alt="Anglican worship in Second Life" /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-2012298949171341253?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
