So I finally let Firefox upgrade itself from version 1.5 to 2.0. They added a helpful "suggestions" feature to the Google search box. Unfortunately, it is completely unfiltered:<br /><br /><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2007/wif.gif" /><br /><br />Message to Firefox developers: THERE IS LOTS OF PORN ON THE INTERNET. And I didn't give you permission to bring it to my attention.<br /><br />To turn off the suggestions feature, right-click on the search box:<br /><br /><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2007/show-suggestions.gif" /><br /><br />I've let Mozilla know that I think this is a terrible blunder, and <a href="http://hendrix.mozilla.org/">I encourage you to do the same</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-7819752226891602191?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
