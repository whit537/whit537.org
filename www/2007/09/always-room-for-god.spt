I'd like to retract my earlier <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/08/god-personal-infinity.html">pantheism</a>. The main point there is that science can never "squeeze out" God, because the set of things beyond the known Universe&mdash;the unknown Universe&mdash;is necessarily infinite, and necessarily infinitely larger than the known Universe. There is always room for God.<br /><br />The <span style="font-style: italic;">content</span> of the unknown Universe is precisely not available to science. However, calling the unknown Universe and God identical is not my preferred answer.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-3374882673124318382?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
