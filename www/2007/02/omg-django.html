When I was in Chicago a while back, I tried explaining <a href="http://www.zetadev.com/software/httpy/0.9a2/man/">the old httpy</a> to Ian Bicking. His response: "Why don't you just use WSGI?" He was <a href="http://tech.whit537.org/2006/11/httpy-is-now-wsgi-middleware.html">right</a>.<br /><br />Last year at PyCon, I pigeon-holed Guido and forced him to tell me why <a href="http://www.zetadev.com/software/httpy/0.9.0/man/overview.html">raising all HTTP Responses</a> was in fact a bad idea. He was *ahem* <a href="http://www.zetadev.com/software/httpy/0.9a2/man/overview.html">right</a>.<br /><br />Also at PyCon, I found myself slinging lots of bullsh-t to a table full of smart people. Ben Collins-Sussman listened patiently, and then interjected, "You should really check out Django."<br /><br />Folks, you'd think I'd <a href="http://tech.whit537.org/2006/10/my-name-is-chad-and-i-have-nih.html">learn</a>. Today it is my pleasure to announce to you all that Django is, in fact, the bee's knees.<br /><br />I've grown more comfortable with Django lately in helping some folks get it working with <a href="http://www.zetadev.com/software/aspen/">Aspen</a>. Tonight I looked at actually migrating a site to Django. It went extremely well. I was afraid it'd be too hegemonic, but in fact it fits perfectly in <a href="http://www.zetadev.com/software/aspen/0.7/doc/html/introduction.html">a hybrid scheme</a>: some files published from the filesystem, some URLs handled by Django. I was able to add just the admin piece, for a single database table that needed an interface. This is huge, because we still manage some content in WordPress! Instead of a risky whole-sale migration, we benefit immediately, and can rescue other parts of the site from PHP at our own pace.<br /><br />Thank you Django, and thank you Ben!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-6376658030240152920?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
