Things were hectic in the run-up to PyCon, so I'm doing a little spring cleaning, pruning <a href="http://tech.whit537.org/2007/02/one-directory-500000-files.html">old projects</a> and what not. Now, there's something beautiful about a directory: a simple listing can hide so much complexity.<br /><pre>$ ls<br />foo<br />$ rm -rf foo</pre>Is this going to take a fraction of a second or, as in my case, is it going to take 20 minutes? Time for a blog post ...<br /><br />PyCon was great. More subdued than last year, and not only because I spent both flights <a href="http://www.amazon.com/I-Heard-the-Owl-Call-My-Name/dp/0440343690">contemplating</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Road/dp/0307265439/">death</a>. We had a good time on the <a href="http://panela.blog-city.com/testing_tools_panel_pycon.htm">testing tools panel</a>, although with 10 guys and 45 minutes we didn't get very far. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=zjangogears">Ian</a> and <a href="http://zestyping.livejournal.com/221226.html">Ping</a> and a guy from <a href="http://www.python.jp/Zope/">PyJUG</a> gave some sweet lightening talks. I got to play with an <a href="http://www.laptop.org/laptop/">OLPC laptop</a> (apparently the hardware is finalized but the software needs work: the CPU monitor uses about 70% of the CPU!). <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2007-February/002488.html">Bob and I</a> had a crew each night, although things never got too crazy, just <a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/python-packaging.html">a little crazy</a>.<br /><br />I organized an impromptu session on web deployment, billed as "the bottom 5% of the web stack." Unfortunately I should have checked my <a href="http://www.zetadev.com/software/aspen/">ulterior motives</a> at the door. Then we'd have had more time to talk about the interesting stuff: <a href="http://www.rpath.com/">Joe Tate</a> and <a href="http://www.zope.com/">Jim Fulton</a> each deploy to some pretty demanding environments, for example. Process monitoring (a la daemontools, monit, zdaemon) turns out to be a significant requirement. And TurboGears and Pylons are merging, for pete's sake! Now <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> is worth talking about. Sorry guys.<br /><br />On the other hand, it was great to see Jim <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0116506/2005/03/10.html#a301">in action</a> building consensus, and then landing the discussion with <a href="http://www.aminus.org/blogs/index.php/fumanchu/2007/02/25/pycon_2007_and_cherrypy">specific next steps</a>. Do I care about performance? Not really. Am I excited about Paste Deploy? <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2006-December/002417.html">Decidedly not</a>. But it's the disagreements and the compromises and, yes, the <a href="http://dirtsimple.org/2005/10/self-version-20.html">wackiness</a> that make it remarkable when we actually do work together.<br /><br />I find the tension between <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fate-Communion-Anglicanism-Future-Global/dp/0802832822">purity and community</a> so fascinating, between <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/11/this_must_be_ha.html">agenda and relationship</a>, <a href="http://www.unlockthegame.com/TheCallThatChangedEverything/">selling and listening</a>. Face time both heightens and resolves this tension, and I love it.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-3098781905580117002?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
