I recently started tracking my friend <a href="http://www.jimgibbon.com/">Jim Gibbon's blog</a>, which means I read <a href="http://jimgibbon.com/2007/02/04/you-call-that-a-bible-quiz-this-is-a-bible-quiz/">posts like this</a>, about two Bible trivia quizzes, one pretty up-the-middle, another with an atheist slant. I took the quizzes and scored about the same as Jim. Yes: the Bible has juicy bits—Genesis 19:8 and Ezekiel 23:20 are two others that stand out for me—but I still bother to study it, and indeed to take it as in some sense authoritative. Why?<br /><br />By way of answer, watch this video. It's one of the first lectures you get in the <a href="http://www.eecs.mit.edu/">EECS</a> curriculum at MIT, and it's the best explanation I've found of—my phrase—the <span style="font-style: italic;">Principles of Scale</span>. It's a long video. However, this idea of scale is going to show up all over this blog, so if you plan on engaging with me, this video is required viewing:<br /><br /><embed style="width: 400px; height: 326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=1249921811850501394&hl=en" flashvars="&amp;subtitle=on"><br /><br />For now, let's let this sit. I'll be back later to try to draw the connection.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-6765536584614695615?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
