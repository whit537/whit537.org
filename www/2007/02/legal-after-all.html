Our favorite pasttime growing up was exploring Sewickley Heights. One night we were hiking up a meadow, when we found a door into the hillside, in a grove of trees. It led into a narrow, dank passage-way that made a loop, bringing us back out the same door. We climbed up above it: there was an old swimming pool, along with the foundation and chimney of a two-story pool house. Our tunnel was the pool's maintenance corridor. We were far enough from the manor house, and with enough tree cover that thenceforth we spent many a night around a fire next to this old pool.
