Having <a href="http://tech.whit537.org/2007/01/should-i-support-ironpython-will-it.html">stuck my neck out</a>, I figured I'd give <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython">IronPython</a> a whirl. It wasn't any harder to set up than CPython on Windows. I downloaded the ZIP, and unpacked it to <code>C:\IronPython-1.0.1</code>, which I then added to PATH. Apparently I already have .NET 2.0 installed, because I now have <code>ipy</code> at the command-line!<br /><br />The next issue is libraries: IronPython doesn't seem to obey <code>PYTHONPATH</code> (no?). Manually placing <code>C:\Python24\Lib</code> in <code>sys.path</code>, I can now import <code>os</code>, <code>email</code>, etc.<br /><br />The reason I tried importing <code>email</code> is because it's written by Barry Warsaw, and he uses ASCII form feeds (<code>&#94;</code>) in his code. I <a href="http://aspen.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/aspen/__init__.py">do too</a>, but IronPython <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=7982">doesn't like them</a> unless they're followed by a line break. Boo.<br /><br />So to answer <a href="http://tech.whit537.org/2007/01/should-i-support-ironpython-will-it.html">my question</a>: setting up an IronPython development environment doesn't hurt, assuming you're already testing CPython on Windows. But there is still an indeterminate portability tax. For now I'll take <a href="http://tech.whit537.org/2007/01/should-i-support-ironpython-will-it.html#c1280296146494369300">Fuzzyman's advice</a>: "Perhaps you should wait until you have some users who need this."<br /><br />In other news, did you know Microsoft has an <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/">Open Source code hosting site</a>? Take Microsoft's dull sense of craftsmanship, and sprinkle it liberally with Web 2.0 dust (tag clouds, gradients, voting, RSS). Stir once. I wonder if they did a <a href="http://www.baselinemag.com/article2/0,1540,2082921,00.asp">SQL Server</a> <a href="http://blog.red-bean.com/sussman/?p=39">backend for svn</a>? Ok, I'm being mean, sorry. :^)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-5842893160951205381?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
