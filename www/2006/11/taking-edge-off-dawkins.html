<p>When <a href="http://richarddawkins.net/">Richard Dawkins</a> <a
    href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA9sFkYZSk8#t=0m15s">preaches to the
    choir</a>, or takes <a
    href="http://www.rationalresponders.com/the_root_of_all_evil_by_richard_dawkins_a_must_see">a
    bully pulpit</a>, or <a
    href="http://www.amazon.com/God-Delusion-Richard-Dawkins/dp/0618680004/">climbs
    on a soapbox</a>, his zeal against the bogeyman of fundamentalist religion
is apostolic ... and boring. Things get interesting, though, when he&rsquo;s
faced with the reality of articulate Christianity.</p>

<p>For example, <a
    href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yENWf5ThIg4">Jeremy Paxman&rsquo;s
    interview</a> with Dawkins (<a
    href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/5317564.stm#god">BBC
    original</a>) starts off the same as, e.g., <a
    href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njo-SX01eOY">Huw Edwards&rsquo;</a>
(<a
    href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/avdb/news/video/60000/bb/60661_16x9_bb.ram">BBC</a>):
another vector for the scientist&rsquo;s meme. However, Paxman turns the heat
up a bit when he asks whether &ldquo;all religiously inclined scientists are
bad
scientists.&rdquo; Dawkins looses tempo, and Paxman presses for a real answer.
Watch what happens:</p>

<p>When Dawkins finally admits that there are indeed prominent Christian
scientists, he is &ldquo;baffled&rdquo; by them. They must &ldquo;do it by a
kind of compartmentalization of the mind.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t understand
them, or barely so.<br />

<!-- original: http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1555132,00.html -->

<p>One such prominent Christian scientist is <a
    href="http://www.genome.gov/10000779">Francis Collins</a>. Happily, TIME
magazine recently brought the two <a
    href="http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1555132,00.html">together
    for a &ldquo;spirited exchange&rdquo;</a>. The conversation peaks when
Collins raises the classic worldview questions&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Why am I
here?&rsquo;, &lsquo;What happens after we die?&rsquo;, &lsquo;Is there a
God?&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;suggesting that religion has a place in answering such
questions. Dawkins doesn&rsquo;t
disagree outright, but rather objects to the <i>particularity</i> of
religion:</p>

<blockquote>
    
    <p><b>DAWKINS:</b> To me, the right approach is to say we are profoundly
    ignorant of these matters. We need to work on them. But to suddenly say the
    answer is God&mdash;it&rsquo;s that that seems to me to close off the
    discussion.</p>
    
    <p><b>TIME:</b> Could the answer be God?</p>  
    
    <p><b>DAWKINS:</b> There could be something incredibly grand and
    incomprehensible and beyond our present understanding.</p>  
    
    <p><b>COLLINS:</b> That&rsquo;s God.</p>
  
    <p><b>DAWKINS:</b> Yes. But it could be any of a billion Gods. It could be
    God of the Martians or of the inhabitants of Alpha Centauri. The chance of
    its being a particular God, Yahweh, the God of Jesus, is vanishingly
    small&mdash;at the least, the onus is on you to demonstrate why you think
    that&rsquo;s the case.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I suggest this volley was central to the conversation because Dawkins refers
to it again in his closing remarks:</p>

<blockquote>
    
    When we started out and we were talking about the origins of the universe
    and the physical constants, I provided what I thought were cogent arguments
    against a supernatural intelligent designer.  But it does seem to me to be
    a worthy idea. Refutable&mdash;but nevertheless grand and big enough to be
    worthy of respect. I don&rsquo;t see the Olympian gods or Jesus coming down
    and dying on the Cross as worthy of that grandeur.  They strike me as
    parochial. If there is a God, it&rsquo;s going to be a whole lot bigger and
    a whole lot more incomprehensible than anything that any theologian of any
    religion has ever proposed.

</blockquote>

<p>Whoa! A supernatural intelligent designer is a worthy idea?! Not exactly the
sinner&rsquo;s prayer, but there&rsquo;s much more common ground here than
Dawkins&rsquo; usually controversial public persona would prepare us for. From
here we actually have the possibility of a humane and interesting
conversation.</p>
