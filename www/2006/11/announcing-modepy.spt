Ok, time for some code! I've ripped <a href="http://www.zetadev.com/software/mode.py/">mode.py</a> out of httpy, rewritten it as a module instead of a singleton class, documented it, tested it, and released it on it's own. Here's <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-announce-list/2006-November/005374.html">the announcement</a>, and here's <a href="http://www.zetadev.com/software/mode.py/">the homepage</a>. And in keeping with <a href="http://beta.blogger.com/2006/10/my-name-is-chad-and-i-have-nih.html">my effort to be on the team</a>, I made sure that <code>easy_install mode.py</code> works.<br /><br />It feels good to release something again, however small.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-2012151758569850306?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
