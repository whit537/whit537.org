After <a href="/2006/11/announcing-aspen-wsgi-rific-web-server.html">a flurry</a> of <a href="/2006/11/aspen-screencast.html">initial</a> <a href="/2006/12/aspen-04-and-beyond.html">activity</a> with <a href="/2006/12/aspen-turning-corner-towards-10.html">Aspen</a>, I've spent my FOSS cycles over the past week or two working on a <a href="/2006/12/talking-to-subversion-from-python.html">skunkworks</a> <a href="/2006/12/nih-roundup-epi-jinja-pasteprofile.html">project</a>. I'm really excited about it, because I expect it to be something I can  pitch directly to clients.<br /><br />However, I want to keep Aspen moving forward too. I hope to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/aspen/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=milestone%3A0.7">release 0.7</a> before year's end, but in the mean time I've kept the dream alive by suggesting that <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2006-December/002434.html">Guido use Aspen</a> for <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8502904076440714866">Mondrian</a>—yeah right!—and that <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/django-users/browse_frm/thread/3efa3486bbf68ea0">Simon Willison use Aspen to serve Django</a>. This latter is slightly more realistic, as Django doesn't really have a compelling pure-HTTP deployment scenario. There's already <a href="http://xhtml.net/scripts/Django-CherryPy-server-DjangoCerise">a Django wrapper for CherryPy's server module</a>. However, I think there may be value in a WSGI server that is common ground for multiple Python web frameworks. We shall see.<br /><br />As a side-note, this is the first I've heard of <a href="http://wiki.codemongers.com/Nginx">the Nginx webserver</a>. It's a better-maintained, Russian <a href="http://lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a>: small, fast, and impossible to pronounce. Merry Christmas!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-2364365485749170985?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
