<p>Here are some excerpts from Adam Smith&rsquo;s <a
    href="http://www.econlib.org/LIBRARY/Smith/smWN.html"
    mce_href="http://www.econlib.org/LIBRARY/Smith/smWN.html"><i>An Inquiry
        into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</i></a> (references
are to the margin numbers in the version linked):</p>

<blockquote>

    The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies
    it with all the necessaries and conveniencies of life. [I.I.1]

</blockquote>
<blockquote>

    The greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour [...] have
    been the effects of the division of labour. [I.1.1]

</blockquote>
<blockquote>

    
    This division of labour [is the] consequence of a certain propensity in
    human nature [...]; the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing
    for another. [I.2.1]

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    
    [M]an has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren, and
    it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only. [...]
    It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the
    baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own
    interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their
    self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their
    advantages. [I.2.2]

</blockquote>
<blockquote>

    As it is by treaty, by barter, and by purchase, that we obtain from one
    another the greater part of those mutual good offices which we stand in
    need of, so it is this same trucking disposition which originally gives
    occasion to the division of labour.  [I.2.3]
    
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    
    What are the rules which men naturally observe in exchanging [goods]
    either for money or for one another, I shall now proceed to examine. These
    rules determine what may be called the relative or exchangeable value of
    goods. [I.4.12]

</blockquote>

<p>These excerpts take us through the opening argument of <i>Wealth of
    Nations</i>. Given the book&rsquo;s reputation, this amounts to the opening
stanza in the chronicle of capitalism, of which marketing is a function.
Therefore, this passage has always stuck in my mind as the place to begin when
thinking about economics and marketing. I&rsquo;m going to leave it sit
unadorned for now, but I expect I&rsquo;ll return to it periodically as this
blog
proceeds.</p>
