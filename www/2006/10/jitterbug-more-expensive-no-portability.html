I've looked seriously into getting a <a href="http://www.jitterbug.com/">Jitterbug</a> cell phone, which I <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/jitterbug_and_the_cellphone_simplicity_derby.php">discovered on Signal vs. Noise</a>. Here's what I found.<br /><br />Their biggest monthly plan only has 300 minutes, so you have to buy extra minutes somehow. Your options are three:<br /><br />1. Buy on the fly, at $0.35/min.<br />2. Buy a prepaid "Service Pack." $25 for 100 min = $0.25/min<br />3. Buy an annual plan. $569 for 3600 min = $0.16/min<br /><br />The annual plan is your best option. It gets you 20% (~$30) off the price of the phone, plus free voicemail. This works because you can use the minutes as fast as you want, and you can buy another annual plan sooner than 12 months.<br /><br />As far as hidden costs go, there is a $35 activation fee, plus shipping for the phone. They currently only charge state taxes, and only for a few states (Pennsylvania is not among them; Illinois and I believe California are). There are no long distance or roaming charges. They claim to have national coverage, but they weren't able to tell me what networks they use. And unfortunately, they don't offer number portability, so you'll be getting a new phone number.<br /><br />Just as the website (implicitly) promises, I immediately connected to a real, live, friendly woman each time I called their overseas call center (800-918-8543) or their home office (800-733-6632; to answer the tax question).<br /><br />My bottom line: With an extra AC charger ($19) and a (generous?) $20 for shipping, I'm looking at an initial outlay of $190 plus the $569 annual plan, or $760. At my rate of usage, I'll need another annual plan in about 9 months. This works out to about $64/mo, which is more than I pay now. Factor in the one-time costs and the pain of switching phone numbers, and it looks like I'm staying put for now.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-2837109533187222788?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
