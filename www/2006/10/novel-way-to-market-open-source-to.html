Here's an interesting idea: jump-start interest in your open source project with <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-announce-list/2006-October/005336.html">prize money</a>. (But make sure your landing pages are well-designed.)<br /><br />Add this to Grig's <a href="http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2006/10/90-9-1-rule-and-building-open-source.html">list of ways to build an open-source community</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-3404841858677888349?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
