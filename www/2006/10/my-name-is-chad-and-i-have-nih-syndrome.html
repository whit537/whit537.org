I've got a serious case of <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?NotInventedHere">NIH syndrome</a> that I need to break. It's hindering me from both making money and having fun. For example, I didn't invent <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools">setuptools</a>. I don't understand it, I'm afraid of it, and I want it to go away. Smart people like it, though, and I want to play with smart people, so I'm going to give it a try.<br /><br />I've got a project called <a href="http://www.zetadev.com/software/testosterone/">testosterone</a>, which is a <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=curses">curses(3)</a> interface for running <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-unittest.html">unittests</a>. I like it, but I don't get to work on it much.<br /><br />Hither, I see the <a href="http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/">nose test runner</a>; yon, the <a href="http://excess.org/urwid/">urwid console UI library</a>. Both appear to be sane and maintained. The part of testosterone that I care about is the <a href="http://www.zetadev.com/software/testosterone/screencast.html">user interface</a>, but writing my own scrolling algorithms (badly) is maybe a bit <span style="font-style: italic;">too</span> manly. Can't I just use urwid? I'm less attached to testosterone's test discovery algorithm, and I think nose's looks just fine. Since nose uses setuptools' plugin architecture, could I simply reimplement testosterone as a nose plugin?<br /><br />Let's give it a shot ...<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-8335937721041133276?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
