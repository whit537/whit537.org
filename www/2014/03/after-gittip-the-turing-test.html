<p>My philosophy reading group, <a
    href="http://whit537.org/2013/01/humbled-and-excited.html">SAPS</a>, is on
the rocks; I just bowed out for the indefinite future. Gittip is coming up on
its two-year anniversary. These two factors together have me thinking about my
future in the academy, the second of three career foci that I&rsquo;m
advertising on my Gittip statement:</p>

<blockquote>
    
    I am making the world better by tinkering with the economy, the academy,
    and the church.

    <ul>
        <li>economy: https://www.gittip.com/</li>
        <li>academy: http://abstract.io/n</li>
        <li>church: http://xmin.org/</li>
    </ul>

</blockquote>

<p>I just reviewed <a href="http://whit537.org/2012/11/my-goals.html">My
    Goals</a>, and it looks to me like this statement is in line.  I&rsquo;d
like to clarify it in two ways. First, Gittip is about <i>generosity</i>.
That&rsquo;s the key word, despite the mission&rsquo;s current wordiness.
Second, I&rsquo;m going to start exploring the Turing Test as a possible focus
for the philosophical/academic part of my career.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been intrigued by the Turing Test for years, but it has felt out
of reach. It still feels out of reach, but closer. For one, I just finished
<i>Philosophical Investigations</i> and <i>Cryptonomicon</i>, so Turing and his
milieu feel more like people to me now, parts of something that I also maybe
could be a part of. Gittip&rsquo;s success to date and my brushes with academic
philosophy are also boosting my confidence.</p>

<p>What I like about the Turing Test is that it gives philosophy something to
break itself against. As with Gittip, I&rsquo;m not interested in idle chatter,
I want to bring forth something real into the world. Abstract.io/n is not an
end in itself. The point is to discover truth. The truth I am interested in
discovering is the truth about what human experience consists in, what its
possibilities and limits are. As Kant says, &ldquo;[I]t must be possible [...]
to attain certainty either concerning our knowledge or lack of knowledge of the
objects [of metaphysics], or certainty concerning the ability or inability of
reason to make judgments about these objects&rdquo; (<i>CPR</i>, B22). Or, as
Wittgenstein says, &ldquo;The real discovery is the one that allows me to break
off philosophizing when I want to.&mdash;The one that gives philosophy peace,
so that it is no longer tormented by questions which bring <i>itself</i> in
question&rdquo; (<i>PI</i>, &sect;133). I want to find Kant&rsquo;s second
certainty, Wittgenstein&rsquo;s real discovery, and that means thoroughly
charting conscious human experience. What surer sign of having understood human
consciousness than replicating it in some fashion?</p>

<p>The current best instantiation of the Turing Test is the Loebner Prize.
Turns out it&rsquo;s rather <a
href="http://www.salon.com/2003/02/26/loebner_part_one/">colorful</a>, and
consequently ostracized from mainstream research. Could be a fun place to play,
especially if I remain an outsider. However, there are <a
href="https://www.sciencemag.org/content/336/6078/164.summary">rumblings</a>
that the mainstream is almost ready to revisit the Turing Test. Either way, I
would expect to tackle the Turing Test in the same open and crowd-friendly way
in which I&rsquo;m approaching Gittip.</p>

<p>As I alluded to above and have <a
    href="http://whit537.org/2007/09/answering-identity-crisis.html">hinted
at</a> in years past, I have some trouble identifying with mainstream society.
For example, I&rsquo;m pretty strongly turned off by the thought that any 
winner of the Loebner Prize will have simply paved the way for the next
generation of mindless entertainment and war. Gittip is an attempt to create a
mainstream society I can feel good about being a part of and donating my best
ideas to. Our culture of laziness and violence is a demand-side problem. Gittip
is about warming the collective heart of culture so we care less about
bullshit (presumably the third part of my career will address this somehow,
too, if I ever get there).</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s next? Here&rsquo;s the beginnings of a reading list:</p>

<ul>
    <li>&ldquo;<a href="http://orium.pw/paper/turingai.pdf">Computing Machinery and 
        Intelligence</a>,&rdquo; Turing&rsquo;s original paper</li>

    <li>&ldquo;<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/">The Turing Test</a>,&rdquo;

        <a href="http://philpapers.org/browse/the-turing-test/">curated bibliography</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see if this goes anywhere!</p>
