<p class="no-indent">I received the following via support@gittip.com:</p>

<blockquote>

    <p class="no-indent">Dear Gittip team,</p>

    <p>We love projects created for the open. Things that are developed for
    improvements by everyone. We think opensource is the best way to create.
    Thats why we made Liv.io - an open platform to discover, follow, support
    and be part of opensource projects for hardware, software, movies, music,
    books, places and a lot more to come.

    <p>We would like to initiate an interview series about creators of open source
    and write short stories about their path. Showing ups &amp; downs and the
    motivation behind the open approach of their project. You are invited to be
    part and we would love to hear about your story.</p>

    <p>[questions]</p>

    <p>If you have any material, like pictures, videos or links, you would like
    us to use please send it!</p>

    <p>We&rsquo;re going to write a short essay about you and your project
    and&rsquo;ll show you the result before publishing it on our upcoming <a
    href="http://blog.liv.io/">blog</a>.</p>

    <p>Best regards,</p>
    <p>[etc.]</p>

<p class="no-indent">Here are my answers:</p>

<dl>

    <dt>Shortly describe what you do!</dt>

    <dd>I run Gittip, a way to give money every week to people and teams you
    believe in.</dd>


    <dt>Which occasion sparked your inspiration?</dt>

    <dd>I had a great corporate job but still wasn&rsquo;t happy, and I came to
    believe that the problem was with the shape of the economy as a whole. I
    want an economy based on generosity, gratitude, and love. <a

here</a>.</dd>


    <dt>Tell us more about your motivation that keeps you going!</dt>

    <dd>My deepest motivation is to be found acceptable by Jesus. The Canaanite
    woman in Matthew 15 is my hero. The Eucharist and playing music and being
    in the woods and getting drunk and tickling my kids give me energy to
    return to the Internet and the hustle and the bustle and the noise and to
    keep going.</dd>


    <dt>What is so special about the opensource approach?</dt>

    <dd>Open-source is special to me because it makes God&rsquo;s overflowing
    abundance real and actual and concrete in the world, in history, in human
    society.</dd>


    <dt>What do you enjoy most when working on your project?</dt>

    <dd>Honestly? I love when I can not answer email or chat or phone for a day
    and the family is gone and I can just write software all day. That happens
    rarely. I&rsquo;m learning to deliver product together with others.</dd>


    <dt>How can I interact with your project?</dt>

    <dd>Check out <a

    <dt>If you like, tell us about another open project we should ask for an
    interview!</dt>

    <dd>You should interview <a href="https://twitter.com/balupton">Benjamin
        Lupton</a> from <a href="http://bevry.me/">Bevry</a>. That dude loves
    openness. :-)</dd>
