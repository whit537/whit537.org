<p>I received this question in private email:</p>

<blockquote>

I&rsquo;d like a pocket gospels very similar to your layout. How on earth would
I go about making that? I think it ought to be about the size of an iPhone with
a case, or a moleskine pocket journal. I think 5.5 x 3 would work.  Or 5.75 x
2.75.

</blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s work backwards: You want a book in your hand. In order to have a
book in your hand, someone has to print the book. In order for someone to print
the book, you need to give them a PDF. In order to produce a PDF, you need to
use software that can generate PDFs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already talked about working with printers in <a
    href="/2013/11/some-advice-on-lulu.html">Advice on Lulu</a>. But where does
one start to produce a PDF in the first place?</p>

<p>Professional books are usually laid out with <a
    href="http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html">Adobe InDesign</a>.  If
you&rsquo;re not a designer and/or don&rsquo;t have Adobe software, you can
either hire or otherwise convince a professional designer to lay out your book
for you, or you can try to get away with Word or Google Docs.</p>

<p>For <a href="http://www.logstown.com/the-gospels/"><i>The Gospels</i></a>, I
wrote <a href="https://github.com/whit537/gospels">custom software</a> that
takes the HTML version of the <a href="http://ebible.org/">World English
Bible</a> (WEB) and converts it to PDF, utilizing a third-party tool called <a
href="http://www.princexml.com/">PrinceXML</a>. I ran the resulting PDF through
Adobe Distiller (comes with <a
href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro.html">Acrobat Pro</a>) to make an
industrial-strength PDF that a commercial printer can work with.</p>

<p>You get what you pay for. If you search for books on Amazon that <a
    href="http://www.amazon.com/s/field-keywords=The%20Kingdom%20of%20God%20is%20Within%20You">happen
to be in the public domain</a>, you&rsquo;ll find plenty of editions with
amateur layouts that were probably done in Word. A high-quality book takes an
investment of time and money, so you&rsquo;re either looking at an expensive
hobby, or a much bigger conversation about marketing your book and the business
of publishing.</p>
