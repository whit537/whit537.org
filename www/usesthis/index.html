        <h1>Chad Whitacre&rsquo;s Setup</h1>

        <p>Here is some backstory and more pictures to go along with <a
            href="http://chad.whitacre.usesthis.com/">my interview in The
            Setup</a>.


        <h3>Portrait</h3>

        <p>When I was first contacted for an interview, <a
            href="http://andrew.w.k.usesthis.com/">Andrew W.K.</a> was
        above the fold. I had gotten some goofy pictures taken at PyCon
        2012 at the About.me booth, and I figured that if ever there were a
        time to use the &ldquo;hard core&rdquo; shot, this was it.</p>

        <img src="chad.whitacre.jpg" />

        <p>Here is W.K.&rsquo;s for comparison:</p>

        <img src="andrew.w.k.jpg" />

        <p>Of course my interview didn&rsquo;t go up for a couple weeks
        after his, so the tie-in isn&rsquo;t as strong as I hoped at first.
        I still get a kick out of it though. :-)</p>
       
        <p>Here&rsquo;s the runner-up from that About.me session:</p>

        <h3>Standing Desk</h3>

        <p>My standing desk is on the third floor of our house, tucked into a
        dormer. I refer to my office up there as The Ivory Tower.  It&rsquo;s
        removed from the noise downstairs, but when the trains rumble by you
        definitely feel it more upstairs.</p>

        <img src="standing-desk.jpg" />

        <p>The keyboard has some light modifications. The brass legs change the
        angle so my wrists aren&rsquo;t bent all day. I tried really hard to
        find a machine shop or someone who would thread them to fit the
        existing screw holes, but failed. They&rsquo;re affixed with stickum,
        as is the trackball. I looked into embedding the trackball into the
        keyboard shell but that was infeasible as well.</p>
    
        <img src="keyboard.jpg" />

        <p>The milkbox that holds the cords is from a dairy called Mongs, which
        may or may not be the Mongs Dairy near where my wife grew up. Either
        way, I named a <a href="/mongs/">MongoDB database browser</a> after
        it.</p>

        <h3>Dr. Frankenstein&rsquo;s iPhone</h3>

        <p>When I broke my iPhone it looked like this:</p>

        <img src="iphone.broken.jpg" />


        <p>Below is a montage of me fixing it. You can clearly see the Gorilla
        Glue in the second picture. I tried soldering it three times but
        couldn&rsquo;t get it to hold when I manipulated the wires after
        closing the case. The glue worked great.</p>

        <img src="iphone.fixed.jpg" />


        <p>I never made it to the front of the Genius Bar line. I left after
        interacting with the starry-eyed Googler in front of me, who politely
        refused to shake my hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do the handshake
        thing,&rdquo; is how he said it.</p>


        <h3>Leather Bags</h3>

        <p>I don&rsquo;t know if my wife&rsquo;s grandfather used this
        regularly at IBM, but it&rsquo;s somehow poetic that it fits a MacBook
        so perfectly.</p>

        <img src="leather-laptop-case.jpg" />

        <p>The one from my dad is one he bought in Cambridge, England. I was
        born there while he was in school, so it&rsquo;s at least as old as I
        am. I found it in a box in the garage while in high school, and took it
        to a cobbler to fix. Now that shoe shop is a coffee shop where
        I&rsquo;m a regular.</p>

        <h3>Waffle Iron</h3>

        <p>I bought our waffle iron on eBay for my wife for Christmas, 2011.
        The first batch of waffles from it was inedible, covered in decades of
        grime. It took about six or eight batches to clean the thing and
        perfect the technique, and a couple more to nail the recipe.</p>

        <img src="waffle-iron.jpg" />

        <p>I love this thing. :-)</p>
