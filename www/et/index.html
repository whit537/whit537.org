        <p><b>Tufte + sharing > Tufte</b></p>

        <p>I have followed your work for a decade. I have digested <i>The
            Visual Display of Quantitative Information</i>. I &ldquo;design from
        the outside in,&rdquo; and I &ldquo;do whatever it takes.&rdquo; I
        attended your <a
            href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses">one-day course</a>
        in Washington, DC on May 16, 2011, and while the content was excellent,
        I left scratching my head. Something about the experience felt wrong.
        I&rsquo;ve been preoccupied the rest of the week trying to figure out
        what it was, and am motivated to share the following with ...</p>

        <table id="org-chart">
            <tr>
                <td class="left"><img id="you" src="you.png" /></td>

                <td class="right" rowspan="2">

                    <p>You.</p>

                    <p>It was really hard to convince you not to sign my books.
                    You signed two of my friend&rsquo;s books.  You signed one
                    of his books twice. I tried to shake your hand instead. You
                    extended your left hand because you were holding a silver
                    Sharpie in your right hand. It was awkward.</p>

                    <p>You have an interesting range of signatures, from
                    conventional to stylized:</p>

                    </p>

                    <p>Your latest book, <a
                        href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=000262">published</a>
                    in 2006, bears the stylized version on its spine, and you
                    also use it for your art gallery, which <a
                        href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003h7">opened</a>
                    in October of 2010. It is the logo for the ET brand: <img
                    src="et.inline.png" alt="ET" class="et" />.  All of the
                    above examples date from between the book and the gallery,
                    so their variation is not a simple matter of evolution.
                    Rather, it seems to correlate to perceived value to you.
                    For example, on a fine art print (<a
                        href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/fineart">$200+</a>),
                    you apparently use the full, conventional signature.  For
                    the masses attending your course, it appears that you tend
                    towards the stylized form (such were the examples I
                    personally witnessed).</p>

        <p>Microsoft sacrifices design excellence for profit, and we end up
        with the&mdash;deadly!&mdash;pitch culture of PowerPoint. On the other
        hand, scientists and those who work in the public interest are credible
        because they present evidence instead of a sales pitch. Do you work in
        the public interest? Are you credible?</p>

        <blockquote>&ldquo;Thirty-five, forty dollars a book? 1.4 million
            copies?&rdquo;<br />he says, with a quizzical smile, when I ask about
            money.<br /><span class="multiply">&ldquo;You can

                2007</a></blockquote>

        <p>In the evening after attending your course, I happened to discover
        this video from a couple months ago about some of your recent
        sculptures:</p>

        <iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kJeWcLkA468" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <p>The title sequence shows 11 abstract table-standing &ldquo;sculpture
        forgings.&rdquo; Then we segue to the artist at work. Eighteen taps
        with the mallet, a bit of the automatic hammer, and a run through the
        saw bring us to this embarrassing exchange with an invisible
        assistant:</p>

        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny how we keep getting these profiles!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Yeah, well, we ... we see faces where, you know, all
        wh...&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;... in everything, right!?&rdquo;

        <p>&ldquo;Right, right.&rdquo;

        <p>Groan! Cut to the auctioneer.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;At fifteen five. Back with Alex, at fifteen five. Shall we
        try one more? At fifteen five. At fifteen million, five hundred
        thousand dollars, and the bid is with Alex, against the five of you. At
        fifteen million, five hundred thousand dollars, then. Fair warning!
        Last chance! At fifteen million ... five hundred ... thousand dollars.
        [bang!] Thank you Alex! And the bid is 0055, fifteen million
        five.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>We heard the astounding price seven times: $15,500,000.00.  We
        recall the 11 pieces in the opening sequence. We can multiply.</p>

        <p>Now back to the workshop. The enthusiast is given a name and a face.
        Wielding another piece of hot metal, he asks, &ldquo;What are we doing
        with this guy?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Uh ... give it to me!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all you.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Indeed.</p>

        <p>After your gallery opened, you were asked about the story behind it.
        You begged off an answer, but added a <a
            href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003h7">postscript</a>:
        &ldquo;An informative guide is Don Thompson&rsquo;s book, <i>The $12
            Million Stuffed Shark: The Curious Economics of Contemporary
            Art</i>.&rdquo; Here is a summary of the book from an Amazon <a
            href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E9T57ECQF9WM/">review</a>:</p>

        <p class="indent">[T]his book is an in-depth study of the way the
        contemporary art market functions, [...] the importance of art branding
        in creating an artist&rsquo;s reputation [...] and, most importantly, how
        these art brands are created. One insightful conclusion is that the art
        market, and contemporary art in particular, is as much brand-driven as
        any other high-end luxury market.</p>

        <p>The content in your books and presentation is excellent. The <img
        src="et.inline.png" alt="ET" class="et" /> brand feels like selfish,
        distracting chartjunk.</p>


        <h2><img src="what-if.png" alt="What if ... ?" /></h2>

        <p>To give you the benefit of the doubt, let&rsquo;s think that your
        &ldquo;<a
            href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/s15427625tcq1304_5.pdf">minor
            celebrity</a>&rdquo; has simply exceeded your expectations, and
        you&rsquo;re not sure quite how to handle it. This whole
        self-publishing thing has worked out <i>too</i> well!</p>

        <p>One practice you advocate is finding examples of excellence and
        emulating them. In thinking about how to lead a global movement that
        isn&rsquo;t marred by self-interest, one exemplar familiar to me is
        Guido van Rossum, the creator of the Python open-source programming
        language and so-called &ldquo;Benevolent Dictator for Life&rdquo;
        (BDFL) of the Python community. Since 1991 he has grown the Python
        community into a well-established, non-commercial, global movement.
        However, the Python community is clearly <i>not</i> about him, it is
        about the product, Python. The language is not called Guido.  Its logo
        is not a stylized GvR, and the annual conference is not called BDFLCon.
        The nickname was, of course, <a
            href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=235725">not
            his idea</a>. I&rsquo;ve interacted with Guido on a few occasions,
        and he&rsquo;s never had a Sharpie. I&rsquo;m sure he will be open to a
        conversation if you want his advice.</p>

        <p>This past Monday you made a passing comment, &ldquo;You and ... I
        are not rockstars,&rdquo; which is true on its face. That said, another
        possible role model that I&rsquo;ll mention is Paul Simon.  Check out
        this recent video where he invites a fan onstage during a show, and
        coaches her through a performance of one of his songs:</p>

        <iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AXBlY5CImUU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <p>So beautiful! How human! Here is a world-class performer, giving us
        his absolute best in his later years. Perfectly at ease, he brings
        Rayna into his spotlight, and then steps back, but without leaving her
        stranded. He turns her into a hero. Such grace! With due respect to
        Brad McDougall, Rayna Ford appears here in a much more flattering light
        than your friend does in the sculpture video. Paul may be more
        difficult to reach than Guido, but I expect you&rsquo;ll be able to, if
        you want his advice on graceful celebrity.</p>

        <p>You have in fact created a powerful platform for improving
        humanity&rsquo;s individual and collective cognitive capacity. If that
        or something like it is truly your mission&mdash;and I believe it
        is&mdash;then I suggest it would be better served by a brand that
        isn&rsquo;t centered around Edward Tufte.  What if you opened up
        Graphics Press to other authors? What if you embraced financial
        transparency, and started a non-profit Foundation for Beautiful
        Evidence? What if you granted fellowships for research into individual
        and collective cognition?  What if you reenvisioned the university
        itself, that den of bureaucracy?  Then you would be creating something
        that I would be interested to be a part of.</p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>
