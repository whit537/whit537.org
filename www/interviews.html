<p>Thanks for your interest in interviewing me! :-)</p>

<p>My policy is to only do open interviews, for several reasons, some
altruistic, some cynical, some practical. First, I believe in openness and
collaboration! Second, open interviews are safer for me, because no matter how
you write your story, any interested reader can check the source for
themselves. Relatedly, I basically buy the thesis that <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Journalist_and_the_Murderer">journalism
is fundamentally ethically fraught</a>; by doing open interviews, I intend to
privilege the human interaction between you and me over the story you're going
to fashion out of the raw material of our interaction. Lastly, my policy has
the happy pragmatic side-effect of limiting the number of interview requests I
get, and of ensuring that the interviews I <i>do</i> do are available for the
widest audience ... including you! :-)</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I mean by an open interview:</p>

<ul>

    <li>All my interviews are dedicated to the public domain via <a
        href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>.</li>

    <li>For video (or audio) calls we&rsquo;ll do a Google Hangout on Air.
    These are live-streamed on YouTube and <a
        href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLivwfG4q6DTCmj3ls2a3pSOePoOGt3OYT">archived
        there as well</a>. We&rsquo;ll schedule the call via <a
        href="https://github.com/whit537/whit537.org/issues/new">GitHub</a> or
    <a href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">email</a>, and then I&rsquo;ll send you a
    link to the Hangout when the time comes.</li>

    <li>For email interviews, I&rsquo;ll respond by posting answers here on
    my blog (<a
    href="/2014/02/livio-interview.html">e.g.</a>).</li>

    <li>For podcasts and radio/TV shows or other such things that aren't
    broadcast live in full, I&rsquo;ll record my own version of the experience,
    and publish it immediately.</li>

</ul>

<p>I should also say: I&rsquo;ve found that real-time interviews need to be at
least 45 minutes to be meaningful as conversations. If we spend less time than
that, we don&rsquo;t really get anywhere unexpected or interesting.</p>

<p>I love serendipity in conversation! I love diving deep, chasing rabbit
holes, finding some unexpected insight together! Let&rsquo;s do it!</p>


<h2>Required Reading</h2>

<p>Before contacting me for an interivew, please read &ldquo;<a
    href="https://medium.com/building-gittip/5886749a4ded">Turning Down
    TechCrunch</a>&rdquo; (May, 2013). That was my first experience with media
    attention, and it was formative for me. Please also read &ldquo;<a
        href="http://www.salon.com/2013/10/25/crowdsource_your_salary_an_economy_built_on_love/">Crowdsource
    your salary! An economy built on love</a>,&rdquo; by Andrew Leonard, and
(for bonus points), watch <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPvDuZQoSxA">our hour-long interview</a>.
That&rsquo;s my favorite of the interviews I&rsquo;ve done so far, because I
think it best captures the spirit of what I'm trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>You can find further material on <a
    href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLivwfG4q6DTCmj3ls2a3pSOePoOGt3OYT">this
    YouTube playlist</a>, and linked from the &ldquo;Turning Down
    TechCrunch&rdquo; piece. My second favorite is probably the one <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OerW0Q_2_7o">with Gabe Stein</a>.
        He's more skeptical than Andrew. I haven't done any really hard-hitting
            interviews yet (my <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1E-svVd9Xc">call with
                David Heinemeier Hansson</a> probably comes closest, but that
            wasn't a media interview). Is hard-hitting what you're after?
            Let's do it! :-)</p>


<h2>P.S.</h2>

<p>Some people think I&rsquo;m <a
    href="https://twitter.com/bvac/status/331856529756143617">narcissitic</a>
to have a policy like this. I don&rsquo;t want to dismiss this criticism out of
hand. I&rsquo;ll tell you what: I&rsquo;m making this up as I go along. We all
have to manage our time somehow, and part of how I manage my time is only doing
open interviews.</p>

<p>I also genuinely believe that the best thing for me to do is <i>my
    thing</i>, with nary a care for what you&rsquo;re going to write about me.
Your customer is your audience, and I'm not your audience, I'm your raw
material. I have my own audience that does appreciate watching raw interviews I
do, so if you see a win-win here, by all means, please get in touch.</p>

<p>Okay! I look forward to hearing from you. :-)</p>
