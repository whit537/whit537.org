<p>Thanks for your interest! :-)</p>

<p>My policy is to only do open interviews, because I only want to do work that
is open and transparent and collaborative, if I can at all help it. Doing
private interviews feels to me like a waste of time, because it leads to
duplication of effort. If we share our interview, however, then the next
interested person can start that much further down field&mdash;just as
you&rsquo;re able to! :-)</p>

<p>Practically speaking, here&rsquo;s what that means:</p>

<ul>

    <li>All my interviews are [un]licensed under <a
    href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>.</li>

    <li>For video calls we&rsquo;ll do a Google Hangout on Air. These are
    live-streamed on YouTube and <a
        href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLivwfG4q6DTCmj3ls2a3pSOePoOGt3OYT">archived
        there as well</a>. We&rsquo;ll schedule the call by <a
        href="https://twitter.com/whit537">Twitter</a> or <a
        href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">email</a> and then I&rsquo;ll send you a
    link to the Hangout at our appointed time.</li>

    <li>For email interviews, I&rsquo;ll respond by posting answers here on
    my blog (<a
    href="http://w:8082/2014/02/livio-interview.html">e.g.</a>).</li>

    <li>For podcasts and radio/TV shows or other such things, I&rsquo;ll record
    my own version of the experience, and publish it immediately.</li>

</ul>

<p>I should also say: I&rsquo;ve found that real-time interviews need to be at
least 45 minutes to be meaningful as conversations. If we spend less time than
that, we don&rsquo;t really get anywhere unexpected or interesting.</p>

<p>I love serendipity in conversation! I love diving deep, chasing rabbit
holes, finding some unexpected insight together. Let&rsquo;s do it!</p>


<h2>Required Reading</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re approaching me as a member of the media, please start by
reading &ldquo;<a
href="https://medium.com/building-gittip/5886749a4ded">Turning Down
TechCrunch</a>&rdquo; (May, 2013). That was my first real experience with media
attention, and it was formative for me.</p>

<p>Please also read &ldquo;<a
    href="http://www.salon.com/2013/10/25/crowdsource_your_salary_an_economy_built_on_love/">Crowdsource
    your salary! An economy built on love</a>,&rdquo; by Andrew Leonard, and
    (for bonus points), watch <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPvDuZQoSxA">our hour-long
        interview</a>. That&rsquo;s the best of the interviews I&rsquo;ve done
    so far.</p>

<p>You can find further material on <a
    href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLivwfG4q6DTCmj3ls2a3pSOePoOGt3OYT">this
YouTube playlist</a>, and linked from the &ldquo;Turning Down TechCrunch&rdquo;
piece.</p>


<h2>P.S.</h2>

<p>Some people think I&rsquo;m <a
    href="https://twitter.com/bvac/status/331856529756143617">narcissitic</a>
to have a policy like this. I don&rsquo;t want to dismiss this criticism out of
hand.  I&rsquo;ll tell you what: I&rsquo;m making this up as I go along. We all
have to manage our time somehow, and part of how I manage my time is only doing
open interviews. My ideal of open interviews has the happy pragmatic
side-effect of limiting the number of interview requests I get, and of ensuring
that the iterviews I <i>do</i> do are available for the next interested person
who comes along.</p>

<p>I also genuinely believe that the best thing for me to do is to do my thing,
with nary a care for what you&rsquo;re going to write about me. Your customer
is your audience. I&rsquo;m not your customer, because I can reach my own
audience directly via Twitter, etc.</p>

<p>Okay! I look forward to hearing from you. :-)</p>
