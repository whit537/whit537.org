<p>I&rsquo;m happy to do interviews! And I hope I can say that I&rsquo;m
genuinely humbled by your interest. Thank you! :-)</p>

<p>My policy is to only do open interviews, because I only want to do work that
is open and transparent and collaborative, if I can at all help it. Doing
private interviews feels to me like a waste of time, because it leads to
duplication of effort. If we share our interview, however, then the next
interested person can start that much further down field. Just as you&rsquo;re
able to!  :-)</p>

<p>Practically speaking, here&rsquo;s what that means:</p>

<ul>

    <li>All my interviews are [un]licensed under <a
    href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>.</li>

    <li>For video calls we&rsquo;ll do a Google Hangout on Air. These are
    live-streamed on YouTube and <a
    href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLivwfG4q6DTCmj3ls2a3pSOePoOGt3OYT">archived
    there as well</a>. We&rsquo;ll schedule the call by <a
    href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">email</a> and then I&rsquo;ll send you a link to
    the Hangout at our appointed time.</li>

    <li>For email interviews, I post my answers here on my blog (<a
            href="http://w:8082/2014/02/livio-interview.html">e.g.</a>).</li>

    <li>For podcasts and radio/TV shows or other such things, I record my own
    version of the experience, and publish it immediately.</li>

</ul>

<p>I should also say: I've found that real-time interviews need to be at least
45 minutes to be meaningful as conversations. If we spend less time than that,
we don't really get anywhere unexpected or interesting.</p>

<p>I love serendipity in conversation! I love diving deep, chasing rabbit
holes, finding some unexpected insight together.</p>


<h2>Required Reading</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re approaching me as a member of the media, please start by
reading &ldquo;<a
href="https://medium.com/building-gittip/5886749a4ded">Turning Down
TechCrunch</a>&rdquo; (May, 2013). That was my first real experience with media
attention, and it was formative for me.</p>

<p>Please also read &ldquo;<a
    href="http://www.salon.com/2013/10/25/crowdsource_your_salary_an_economy_built_on_love/">Crowdsource
    your salary! An economy built on love</a>,&rdquo; by Andrew Leonard, and
    (for bonus points), watch <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPvDuZQoSxA">our hour-long
        interview</a>. That&rsquo;s the best of the interviews I&rsquo;ve done
    so far.</p>

<p>You can find further material on <a
    href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLivwfG4q6DTCmj3ls2a3pSOePoOGt3OYT">this
YouTube playlist</a>, and linked from the &ldquo;Turning Down TechCrunch&rdquo;
piece.</p>


<h2>P.S.</h2>

<p>Some people think I'm <a
    href="https://twitter.com/bvac/status/331856529756143617">narcissitic</a>
to have a policy like this. I don't want to dismiss them out of hand. I'll tell
you what: I'm making this up as I go along. We all have to manage our time
somehow, and part of how I manage my time is only doing open interviews. My
ideals have the happy pragmatic side-effect of throttling the number of
interview requests I get, and of ensuring that the iterviews I <i>do</i> do are
available to the next interested person to come along.</p>

<p>I also genuinely believe that the best thing for me to do is to do my thing,
with nary a care for what you&rsquo;re going to write about me. Happily, I
don&rsquo;t need you anymore, now that I have Twitter. I don&rsquo;t know
exactly what your role is in a post-broadcast culture. Honestly? I think
there&rsquo;s some interesting mix of philosophy and journalism to be
explored. But that&rsquo;s not what I'm working on right now. :-)</p>
