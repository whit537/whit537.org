<p>Three things (among others) happened this past week:</p><p></p><ul><li>Registration opened for <a href="http://py.codeconf.com/">PyCodeConf</a>.</li><li>EJ's <a href="http://ejroundtheworld.blogspot.com/2011/07/airbnb-nightmare-no-end-in-sight.html">Airbnb nightmare</a> went viral.</li><li><a href="http://pyohio.org/">PyOhio</a>.</li></ul><p>Let&rsquo;s connect some dots.</p><p></p><p>PyCodeConf is an exclusive, high-end conference put on by Github. It&rsquo;s at a swanky hotel in Miami&rsquo;s South Beach. Registration is $600, plus the $179/night (which is dirt cheap, considering). Local companies are talking about the <a href="https://github.com/blog/893-pycodeconf-tickets-on-sale#comment-13183">roof-top parties</a> they&rsquo;re going to throw. Github is billing it as a meeting &ldquo;with the thought leaders and visionaries that will drive the Python community over the next year.&rdquo; Guido is noticeably absent. So are <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/raymondh">Raymond</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/95810/alex-martelli">Alex</a>, <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/">Ned</a>, <a href="http://jacobian.org/">Jacob</a>, etc., etc., etc. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ctitusbrown/status/95943889604718593">Titus</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/GrahamDumpleton/status/96051347929051136">Graham</a> are actively confused. Interestingly, Jesse Noller is involved. He&rsquo;s the chair of PyCon, which, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, is the actual meeting of thought leaders and visionaries that will drive the Python community over the next year.</p><p>I have no doubt that PyCodeConf will sell out as Github promises. And I have no doubt that the attendees will have a blast drinking on South Beach roof-tops. That actually sounds really fun. But I think Github has miscalculated the character of the Python community.</p><p>PyOhio is much more in keeping with the Python ethos. It&rsquo;s free for attendees (thanks to the volunteer organizers and the corporate sponsors). It&rsquo;s held in a nice, but not flashy, facility (the student union at Ohio State University). And it displays real diversity on the often-overlooked spectrum of coolness. You know who I want to go to conferences with? Yes, the people doing Cool and Interesting Things&mdash;the Googlers and the Facebookies and the people with startup stars in their eyes and the people who are the startup stars. I want them there. But I also want the quirky dude who loves writing really bad Tkinter games with his kids and can say to an audience, with absolute unselfconscious genuineness, &ldquo;I like helping people.&rdquo; That shit is beautiful. I want that at my conference, and I love Python because it&rsquo;s full of that.</p><p>In the <a href="http://codeconf.com/#fine-print">fine print</a> for CodeConf (the general conference that is the pattern for PyCodeConf), there is this reminder:</p><blockquote>While at GitHub Inc. events or related social networking opportunities, attendees should not engage in discriminatory or offensive speech or actions regarding gender, sexuality, race, or religion.</blockquote><p>They forgot coolness.</p><p>One more dot to connect. <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> is a Cool and Interesting Thing. It&rsquo;s a Y Combinator-backed startup with a billion dollar <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/24/Airbnb-bags-112-million-in-series-b-from-andreessen-and-others/">valuation</a>. Now news is breaking about people who were lulled into a false sense of security by Airbnb&rsquo;s brand (with Craiglist, you <i>know</i> to be careful): <a href="http://ejroundtheworld.blogspot.com/2011/07/airbnb-nightmare-no-end-in-sight.html">EJ</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/31/another-airbnb-victim-tells-his-story-there-were-meth-pipes-everywhere/">Troy</a> rented their apartments to derelicts who trashed and robbed them. Yes, the hosts could/should have been more careful. But Airbnb has whiffed on customer service in their follow-up, in a situation much more drastic than the Google customer service <a href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/bt5akp">hiccup</a> from a couple weeks ago. It took a <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/vicgundotra/status/94184809936601090">Hail Mary</a> to Vic Gundotra, but Thomas Monopoly did get his <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/thomasmonopoly/status/96333405423280128">account back</a> in under a week. After a month, Airbnb is mostly <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/27/on-safety-a-word-from-airbnb/">posturing</a>.</p><p>The connection I want to make is that if we forget about humans in our rush to be &ldquo;thought leaders and visionaries,&rdquo; then we&rsquo;ll build companies that also forget about humans. Customer service is expensive and hard. In the rush to do Cool and Interesting Things, it&rsquo;s a tempting corner to cut. Let&rsquo;s do better.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-1773946366736564262?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
