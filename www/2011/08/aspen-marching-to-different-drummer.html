<p><a href="http://mechanicalcat.net/richard">Richard Jones</a> recently
included <a href="http://aspen.io/">Aspen</a> in a Python web micro-framework
shootout for <a href="http://pycon-au.org/">PyCon AU</a>. Video queued to the
Aspen portion, along with slides of the whole thing:</p>

<p>Out of ten contestants, Aspen comes in dead last! <a
    href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/">Bottle</a>&nbsp;wins. But if you read
the notes at the bottom of the slides, there&rsquo;s an interesting
twist.&nbsp;Richard begins his review of Aspen by noting that it has
&ldquo;[q]uite a different approach to things,&rdquo; and concludes it by
saying:</p>

<blockquote>
    
    <p>I&rsquo;ve given Aspen a rough time here because it&rsquo;s not
    really suitable for my purposes, but I can see how it&rsquo;d actually be
    really nice to develop a simple website with.</blockquote>


<p>That&rsquo;s fair &hellip; especially since he doesn't explicitly say that
Aspen would <i>not</i> be really nice for a complex website. ;-)</p>

<img class="cat px128" alt="Aspen is ... different." src="different.128.jpg">

<p>You see, Aspen isn&rsquo;t just a variation on a known web framework
style&mdash;MVC, decorator-driven, class-based. Aspen is a new style. Aspen
digs deeper in order to provide <a
    href="http://blip.tv/pyohio/aspen-a-next-generation-web-framework-5436552">simple,
    powerful, and clean web apps</a>&nbsp;that participate in the zen of the
filesystem, of HTTP, and of Python&mdash;all at once. As a result, Aspen
doesn&rsquo;t fit current preconceived notions of what a web framework should
look like. That&rsquo;s how I interpret the results of this shoot-out. Aspen is
simply marching to a different drummer, per Richard&rsquo;s visual:</p>


<p>Maybe Aspen is the <a
    href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-august-15-2011/indecision-2012---corn-polled-edition---ron-paul---the-top-tier">Ron
    Paul</a> of Python web frameworks? :-)</p>

<h3>Replies to Specific Items</h3>

<p>The major constructive criticism I am hearing is that Aspen&rsquo;s <a
    href="http://aspen.io/">documentation</a> is &ldquo;<i>seriously</i>
thin,&rdquo; which I half-accept. There&rsquo;s a fair amount of information
there, but I&rsquo;m hearing from others as well that it&rsquo;s not presented
in an accessible way, and I can agree with that.  Aspen&rsquo;s documentation
needs to be even better than normal precisely because it pushes the envelope.
It&rsquo;s not there yet.</p>

<p>The other thing I&rsquo;m hearing is that &ldquo;some things are
inexplicably hard.&rdquo; Apart from difficulty with things like page breaks
that are actually part of the zen of Aspen, I was able to identify six specific
instances of inexplicable hardness encountered in the review. I attribute these
to a mixture of documentation failures and missing API. Hopefully I&rsquo;ve
been able to partially remedy some of them, at least, in the 0.11.11
release.</p>

<ol><li><b>Redirects</b> -&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve added a simple
    <code>request.redirect</code> method to make redirects easier. It&rsquo;s
    (thinly) <a href="http://aspen.io/request/">documented</a>. I hadn&rsquo;t
    added it to date because what I really want to do is port the <a
        href="https://bitbucket.org/cherrypy/cherrypy/src/701f413a0d64/cherrypy/_cperror.py#cl-152">more
        robust algorithm from CherryPy</a>, but this is a step in the right
    direction.</li> <li><b>HTML escaping</b> -&nbsp;Aspen's&nbsp;<a
        href="http://aspen.io/templating/">templating</a>&nbsp;documentation
    mentions the helper function for escaping HTML, but didn&rsquo;t mention
    that escaping isn't the default until now. It looks like Tornado made
    escaping the default in 2.0, so I&rsquo;ll look at upgrading that
    library.</li> <li><b>Request&nbsp;API</b> - The&nbsp;<code><a
            href="http://aspen.io/request/">request object</a></code>&nbsp;is
    an unstable API, but all of the interfaces used in Richard&rsquo;s example
    are in fact mentioned in the documentation, including
    <code>request.body</code>. I guess that just goes to show how inaccessible
    the documentation really is. :-(</li> <li><b><span class="Apple-style-span"
            style="font-weight: normal;"><div style="display: inline
                !important;"><b>Content-Type</b> - The default
                <code>Content-Type</code> is <code>text/plain</code>, and this
                is configurable website-wide using the
                <code>default_mimetype</code> key in <code><a
                        href="http://aspen.io/aspen.conf/">aspen.conf</a></code>.
                However, the right way to encode the <code>Content-Type</code>
                for a specific resource in Aspen is via its file extension. In
                Richard&rsquo;s example, the file should be named
                <code>edit.html</code> instead of just
                <code>edit</code>.</div></span></b></li> <li><b><div
            style="display: inline !important;">Manual REST<span
                class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"> - In
general, I consider branching based on request method to be flexible and clean. It&rsquo;s no more manual than specially-naming methods, and the flow of control is easier to keep straight. However, the conditions themselves are a bit
                verbose, so I&rsquo;ve added <code>request.GET</code>, etc., so
                you can use those instead of <code>request.method ==
                    "GET"</code>. This is (thinly) </span></div></b><b><div
            style="display: inline !important;"><span class="Apple-style-span"
                style="font-weight: normal;"><a
                    href="http://aspen.io/request/">documented</a>.</span></div></b></li>
    <li><b>WSGI</b> - Aspen does in fact expose a WSGI callable, at
    <code>aspen.wsgi.website</code>. The <a
        href="http://aspen.io/deployment/">deployment</a> docs identify Aspen
    as a WSGI application and show it used as such under <code>gunicorn</code>
    and <code>spawning</code>. I&rsquo;ve gone back and tweaked that page to
    explicitly mention the location of Aspen&rsquo;s WSGI callable.</li>
</ol>

<p>One last detail: Richard advises putting a script in your site root, but you
shouldn&rsquo;t do that because it will be accessible through the web. It
won&rsquo;t run if you hit it, but you still don&rsquo;t want that visible, do
you? Things like that belong either up a level or in the <code>.aspen</code>
hidden directory, though honestly Aspen thinks of itself more as an app server
than a web framework. It&rsquo;s primarily designed to be run as an executable
from the command line, and only secondarily to be imported as a library into a
script of your own devising.</p>

<p>Thanks to Richard for putting Aspen to the test and providing valuable
feedback!</p>
