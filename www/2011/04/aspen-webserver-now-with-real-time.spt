<p>Greetings, Planets Python. I've started working on the <a href="http://aspen.io/">Aspen webserver</a> again, with a focus on the <a href="http://aspen.io/simplates/">simplates development pattern</a>. Under the hood I've started using the <a href="http://www.dieselweb.org/">diesel non-blocking socket engine</a>, which means that Aspen is ready for real-time. I'm currently releasing development snapshots in the 0.9 line towards a stable 1.0 release. If you're interested in an alternative development pattern and an accessible real-time story, <a href="http://aspen.io/">check out Aspen</a>.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-1023912430547372428?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
