<p>On July 13, Adbusters Magazine published a call to action entitled
&ldquo;a shift in revolutionary tactics.&rdquo; Quote:</p>

<blockquote>

    <p>On September 17, we want to see 20,000 people flood into lower
    Manhattan, set up tents, kitchens, peaceful barricades and occupy Wall
    Street for a few months. [The Egyptian revolution] succeeded in large part
    because the people of Egypt made a straightforward ultimatum &ndash; that
    Mubarak must go &ndash; over and over again until they won. Following this
    model, what is our equally uncomplicated demand?</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.adbusters.org/blogs/adbusters-blog/occupywallstreet.html">http://www.adbusters.org/blogs/adbusters-blog/occupywallstreet.html</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Soon afterwards they published this catchy poster, asking &ldquo;What is our
one demand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On September 17 the Occupation of Wall Street began, and as of this moment
three and a half weeks later there are now meetups in 1,390 cities and towns
across the United States under the heading <a
    href="http://www.occupytogether.org/">Occupy Together</a>.</p>


<h3>The Difference Between Occupation and Protest</h3>

<p>The Adbusters call to action and the coverage of the occupation so far have
focused on political and economic issues. But I believe that beneath the
political and economic protests there is a deeper spiritual possibility.</p>

<p>The people in Zuccotti Park are doing two things. First, they are marching,
making signs, getting arrested, etc. They are protesting. However muddy it is,
they do have an agenda: End corporate personhood. Tax the rich. Etc., etc.</p>

<p>But they're also doing something bigger than protesting. Every night several
hundred of them actually sleep in the park. They've set up a kitchen and a
library and a first aid station. There are lectures and music and art going on.
This is not protest. This is occupation.</p>

<p>Protest is one thing, and occupation is something different. Protest is
about accomplishing specific political goals. Occupation is about turning
public places into living, face-to-face communities. Protest is temporary.
Occupation goes on indefinitely. Protest is political. Occupation is deeper
than politics. Occupation is spiritual.</p>


<h3>What is Our One Demand?</h3>

<p>Some are <a
    href="http://occupywallst.org/forum/proposed-list-of-demands-please-help-editadd-so-th/">quixotically
    trying</a> to come up with the single demand that Adbusters originally
called for. Douglas Rushkoff is closer to the mark when he sees the question as
essentially rhetorical:</p>

<blockquote>

    <p>[U]nlike a traditional protest, which identifies the enemy and fights
    for a particular solution, Occupy Wall Street just sits there talking with
    itself, debating its own worth, recognizing its internal inconsistencies
    and then continuing on as if this were some sort of new normal. It models a
    new collectivism.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/05/opinion/rushkoff-occupy-wall-street/">http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/05/opinion/rushkoff-occupy-wall-street/</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Rushkoff ducks the question, but hints at the spiritual possibility of
occupation in the phrase &ldquo;new collectivism.&rdquo; If the question is
taken not politically or economically but spiritually, there is a clear and
simple answer.</p>

    <a href="answer.png"><img src="answer.medium.png" /></a>
</div></div>

<p>Love is the one demand.</p>

<p>What I want from my society is love. I want to walk into any neighborhood in
the world without fear. I want to know that everyone is cared for. I want to
trust that people in leadership are fit for it. I want love to be normal.</p>

<p>There is a two-way street between society and its members, but fundamentally
the character of a society bubbles upwards from its members. If we have greedy
corporations and opportunistic governments and divisive media, it&rsquo;s
because we as a public are greedy and opportunistic and divisive. If we want
change in our governments and corporations and media, then the place to start
is in our hearts and homes. As <a
    href="http://www.thenation.com/article/163719/occupy-wall-street-faq">one
    occupier of Wall Street said</a>: &ldquo;Occupy your own heart, not with
fear but with love.&rdquo; Political protests can and do achieve real
short-term change. But the systemic change we all long for will only happen as
love takes root in the public character.</p>

<p>And this is why occupation as a new spiritual practice is interesting.
Intentionally inhabiting public spaces together links my personal spiritual
practice with society as a whole. It is important that occupation happen out of
doors and with a minimum of organization, so that it has the widest
inclusivity. Love over fear is something that I believe we are ready to all
agree on. Occupation needn&rsquo;t threaten existing spiritual communities.  I
plan to be in church on Sunday and occupy the park on Thursday. But occupation
itself must be general: intentionally inhabiting public spaces together, love
our one demand.</p>

<p>If you agree, then go <a href="http://www.meetup.com/occupytogether/">find
    your occupation</a>.</p>
