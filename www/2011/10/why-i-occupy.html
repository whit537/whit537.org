    <p>My forest hideaway at Occupy Pittsburgh, night one.</p>
</div></div>

<p>A friend of mine linked me to a post asking &ldquo;<a
    href="http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2011/10/17/what-would-jesus-occupy/">What
    Would Jesus Occupy?</a>&rdquo; It sounds like the author didn&rsquo;t like
the way the showdown went down in NYC. I think the occupiers there were right
that it was a veiled attempt to end their occupation, and to be honest I was
surprised and energized and inspired when Brookfield and the city backed down.
It was a decisive moment, and it happened nonviolently. That&rsquo;s Christian
in my book. There&rsquo;s also the matter that the property is semi-public. My
understanding is that there are provisions in city law (at least in Pittsburgh)
that say privately-run parks within the city are held in public trust and are
open to the public. So it&rsquo;s not the same afront to private property as
camping out on the Whitehouse lawn or the Mayor&rsquo;s lawn or my lawn.</p>

<p>In Pittsburgh, relations with BNY Mellon have gotten off to a great start.
They&rsquo;ve said we can be there indefinitely as long as we don&rsquo;t hurt
people or property. The grass was wet and muddy and I was worried that messing
it up would give BNY Mellon an excuse to kick us out. I told a guy as much when
he started toying around with mud wrestling. But, firstly, the occupation ended
up laying down cardboard sidewalks and treating the property with respect. And
then the next day BNY Mellon shipped in straw! How cool is that?</p>

<p>My family and I went down for the kick-off rally on Saturday. I <a
    href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BL3DBpNRPG0">got on the human mic</a>,
and I camped out the first night. I made a point while I was there to approach
the police and get to know them. Ed, the lieutenant on duty while I was there,
was quite supportive. &ldquo;You guys left Market Square cleaner than you found
it. As long as you treat Mellon Green the same way we&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;
He&rsquo;s on record calling the march and rally <a
    href="http://postgazette.com/pg/11288/1182320-100.stm">the
    &ldquo;smoothest&rdquo; protest</a> he&rsquo;s ever seen. I saw no police
stationed around Mellon Green during the night, but we did get supportive honks
from a few driving past.</p>

<h3>Village, Forum, and Jester</h3>

    <a href="outernet.jpg"><img src="outernet.medium.jpg" /></a>

    <p>At 8:00 AM on a Sunday, this small crowd at Occupy Pittsburgh is
    discussing current affairs. It&rsquo;s like the Internet, only better.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The reason I&rsquo;m excited about the Occupy movement is that it brings
together the tribal village, the open forum, and the court jester. Yes, it is
being birthed in a cloud of negative emotion&mdash;anger and frustration and
entitlement and self-righteousness. But the thing being birthed is
beautiful.</p>

<p>In Pittsburgh as I write this we have a bunch of hippies and dropouts and
dreamers and activists setting up a village in the heart of the city.
It&rsquo;s clean and safe and self-organized. It&rsquo;s like a little tribal
village in the heart of the concrete jungle. One of the things I want to see is
homeless people brought into the community that is forming there, given a home
and a family and a healthier place in society.</p>

<p>The Occupation is a modern Mars Hill, the fora and agora at the roots of
democracy in Ancient Greece and Rome. In Pittsburgh I met and talked to people
with a wide range of views, though it does take guts to get up on the human mic
for the first time. All voices are welcome. It&rsquo;s like the Internet, but
face to face, which makes all the difference.</p>

<p>The Occupation is the court jester because it pickets BNY Mellon while
living on its land. It&rsquo;s a strangely symbiotic relationship. Global
society needs big banks to keep the wheels turning, and we need the Occupation
to be our conscience and our forum and to take care of our stragglers.
Occupation works through persistent juxtaposition.</p>
 
<p>Seriously, you should stop by <a
    href="http://www.meetup.com/occupytogether/">your local Occupation</a> and
strike up a conversation with someone or help out in the kitchen. If
you&rsquo;re in Pittsburgh, <a href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">email me</a> and
we&rsquo;ll go together.  And if you&rsquo;re feeling bold, yell &ldquo;Mic
check!&rdquo; in a crowd and see what happens. It&rsquo;s inspiring.</p>
