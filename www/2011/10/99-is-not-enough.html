<p>In 2007-2008 I worked for a religious non-profit called the Anglican
Communion Network (ACN). I made this video while trying to come to terms with
just what it was we were trying to accomplish. I went to great lengths to
ensure that the circles representing humanity, Christianity, Anglicanism, and
The Episcopal Church were to scale relative to each other, according to
population. Zooming in on each successive circle brings that entity to fill the
screen at the same apparent size, but you&rsquo;ll see the relative size of
each given as a percentage of the previous group. The Episcopal Church turns
out to comprise only 0.04% of humanity, and the conservative Anglican movement
in North America is smaller still! If it&rsquo;s a quarter the size of The
Episcopal Church, then that is 0.01% of humanity.</p>

<p>I have a tremendous amount of personal respect for Archbishop Bob Duncan,
the North American leader of the conservative Anglican movement. His gift for
leadership is truly remarkable, and I will always be thankful to have witnessed
it up close. Our office was thick with meaning and purpose&mdash;indeed, divine
appointment. However, juxtaposing our sense of purpose with the reality of our
size relative to humanity had a big impression on me. It led eventually to what
I will call a spiritual awakening, a realization and decision that, for me,
living up to the Gospels actually means siding myself with humanity as a whole
over any given subset of it. So here in 2011, I still attend a small Anglican
parish, but I&rsquo;m no longer an Anglican activist. I now identify with the
100%, not the 0.01%.</p>

<p>This is the context in which I hear the Occupy slogan &ldquo;We are the
99%!&rdquo; For me, this is a step backward. For me, 99% is not enough. I side
with whomever you don&rsquo;t, be they banker or anarchist, tax collector or
sinner.  For me, the potential in Occupy is for us all to side with every
other, meeting face to face in our public spaces without fear, to truly hear
and understand each other so that we can move forward together, in cooperation,
collaboration, and love.</p>
