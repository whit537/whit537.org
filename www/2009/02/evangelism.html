<p>So I'm reading philosophy. Descartes, probably, or Hume. Standing at the corner of 7th and Liberty with lots of humans, waiting for the Route 1, it hits me: philosophy <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic; ">is</span> evangelism. What more do I want from someone than that they think seriously about themselves, about life? What more do I want to convert a person to, beyond <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">engagement</span>?</p><p>I need to test this. Maybe once in ten bus rides, someone will talk to me. My pact: if someone talks to me today, I am going to ask them a question: "What is the most important thing?"<br /></p><p>I'm sitting in the back, reading Descartes or Hume, for 35 minutes; 10 minutes until my stop. Mary makes small talk. Electricity. Not that you face the person sitting next to you when you talk on the bus, but I don't put on my glasses, because I know it's easier if I can't see her. She is wearing a silver puffy coat and has wavy hair. She might have an odd piercing. She's about my age.</p><p>"Hey, I'm sorry, but I have to ask you a weird question. Is that okay?"</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>"Ok, I'm sorry, ... this is weird, but ... I promised myself that the next person I talked to, I would ask this question ... What's the most important thing?" I'm looking at the floor in between us, fidgeting with my glasses.</p><p>"What do you mean? Like ..."</p><p>"Like, what's the most important thing in life. What is the Good. To you, that is ..."</p><p>"To love yourself." No question; confident.</p><p>I pause. "To love yourself. Can I ask why?" (What is philosophy except "why?")</p><p>"Because if you don't love yourself then you can't give a shit about other people." No question.</p><p>I'm the only one feeling uncomfortable. This is going really well. "So, do you love yourself?"</p><p>"Yeah, for the most part ... Do I have regrets? Sure, some."</p><p>Pause. "Is it too much to ask what some of the regrets might be? You don't have to ..."<br /></p><p>"Suicide."</p><p>"You tried to commit suicide?!"</p><p>"Yes. Right after my dad died, 11 years ago. He was the reason my life had meaning. When he died, I tried to kill myself."<br /></p><p>"Sheesh! That's heavy!"</p><p>"Sorry, I was just being honest. I'm a very honest person."</p><p>"No ... thank you! That's awesome! ... That you're honest, I mean, not that you tried to kill yourself ... or that your dad died ..."</p><p>Time's up. I shove my book in my bag and my glasses in my shirt pocket. I grab my coat, stand up, and push the button.</p><p>"Hey, sorry, this is my stop. Thanks for answering my question. My name's Chad, what's your name?"</p><p>"Mary."</p><p>"Thanks, Mary."<br /></p><p>"Have a good day, sir."</p><p><a href="http://www.theaitch.com/">Don't forget the aitch</a>.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-1914637690626937397?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
