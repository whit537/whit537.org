<p>So I'm reading philosophy. Descartes, probably, or Hume. Standing at the
corner of 7th and Liberty with lots of humans, waiting for the Route 1, it hits
me: philosophy <i>is</i>evangelism. What more do I want from someone than that
they think seriously about themselves, about life? What more do I want to
convert a person to, beyond <i>engagement</i>?</p>

<p>I need to test this.Maybe once in ten bus rides, someone will talk to me. My
pact: if someone talks to me today, I am going to ask them a question:
&ldquo;What is the most important thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I'm sitting in the back, reading Descartes or Hume, for 35 minutes; 10
minutes until my stop. Mary makes small talk. Electricity. Not that you face
the person sitting next to you when you talk on the bus, butI don't put on my
glasses, because I know it's easier if I can't see her. She is wearing a silver
puffy coat and has wavy hair. She might have an odd piercing. She's about my
age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, I'm sorry, but I have to ask you a weird question. Is that
okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ok, I'm sorry, ... this is weird, but ... I promised myself that the
next person I talked to, I would ask this question ...  What's the most
important thing?&rdquo; I'm looking at the floor in between us, fidgeting with
my glasses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Like ...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like, what's the most important thing in life. What is the Good. To
you, that is ...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To love yourself.&rdquo; No question; confident.</p>

<p>I pause. &ldquo;To love yourself. Can I ask why?&rdquo; (What is philosophy
except &ldquo;why?&rdquo;)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because if you don't love yourself then you can't give a shit about
other people.&rdquo; No question.</p>

<p>I'm the only one feeling uncomfortable.This is going really well. &ldquo;So,
do you love yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, for the most part ... Do I have regrets? Sure, some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pause. &ldquo;Is it too much to ask what some of the regrets might be? You
don't have to ...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suicide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tried to commit suicide?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Right after my dad died, 11 years ago.  He was the reason my
life had meaning. When he died, I tried to kill myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sheesh! That's heavy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I was just being honest. I'm a very honest person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No ... thank you! That's awesome! ...  That you're honest, I mean,
not that you tried to kill yourself ... or that your dad died ...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Time's up. I shove my book in my bag and my glasses in my shirt pocket. I
grab my coat, stand up, and push the button.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, sorry, this is my stop. Thanks for answering my question. My
name's Chad, what's your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a good day, sir.&rdquo;</p>
