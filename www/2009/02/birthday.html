<p>Mary lives with her younger sister, her two brothers (one older, one
younger), and her Mama in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABLA_Homes#Jane_Addams_and_Grace_Abbott_Homes">one
of the Chicago projects</a> they tore down in the late nineties. I'm with a
girl named Hope. We take the train in from the suburbs and walk the last mile
down to Taylor Street and find the right entrance.</p>

<p>Mary and her family live up a few flights of stairs, behind a battered,
iron-gated door. Their apartment has a kitchen where Mama makes us chitterlings
at Thanksgiving, a living room, two bedrooms, and a bathroom. The main bedroom,
the one with the bed, is where Mama entertains clients. There are two
lightbulbs for the apartment, which I (being tall) help move to where they are
currently needed.</p>

<p>Hope and I are part of a college group that visits Lower Wacker Drive every
Saturday night, making friends with the people that live underneath the Sears
Tower. We meet one of Mama's boyfriends on Lower Wacker, and he introduces us
to Mary's family. It's just the two of us visiting today.</p>

<p>Today there's a boombox playing music in the apartment. I follow Hope
inside. Beyond the iron gate and battered door we learn that it is Mary's
birthday. A few friends are over, and the kids are all dancing in the living
room. Mary has no cake, and no gifts except for friendship bracelets. The one
Mary gives me is red, white, and blue, and is still tied around the neck of my
guitar. Friendship bracelets, and snow.  The first snow of the season falls on
our way back to the train station.  Skipping along under the streetlights, Hope
and I catch the snowflakes on our tongues.</p>
