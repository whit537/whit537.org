<p>Mary needs money for a room. She rents a small room at the Palace Hotel in the Hill District, under the table through Joseph, a custodian that she met at the Baptist church. This has to be discreet. I can't see the place or meet Joseph. She just needs $55 a week or she'll be out under the bridge, where she got raped.</p><p>She does agree to have Joseph call me. So Joseph calls me. Mary needs $55 a week for her room at the Palace Hotel in the Hill District, which he rents to her under the table. They met at the Baptist church.</p><p>I leave work early on a Friday, and run into Mary outside on my way to the garage. This is a pleasant surprise. We agree to meet in the alley after I run a few errands, and then I'll take her to her place so she can pay her rent.</p><p>Now I'm sitting in my <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/08/welcome-to-bourgeoisie.html">2007 Toyota Sienna</a>, parked behind Joseph's 1989 Buick Century, tan except for the front right panel, which is matte black. He pulled up just as we did, returning from the bank. I watch him enter as Mary gets out of the car. I watch Mary follow him inside. The side windows are all dark. One or two are boarded up. The front windows are populated with neon beer signs, lit, but I don't believe the painted sign that says "Bar open Sundays." I don't think there is a bar anymore.</p><p>Inside, Joseph is fiddling with a padlock on an iron gate. Mary, with her eyes, reiterates that this has to be discreet, that I can't see the place or meet Joseph. Joseph doesn't look up to ask me if he can help me, sir. No, I'm just a friend of Mary's. The place is dirty and empty, and there is no bar. I leave.</p><p>Mary forgives me. "That's ok, you were curious, it's understandable. You know what they say about curiosity."</p><p>"Um, that it killed the cat?"</p><p>She smiles.</p><p>"Mary, would it be fair to use the word 'flop-house' to describe the Palace Hotel?"</p><p>"No, there's none of that there. It's a pretty clean place. After all, the police station is only a block up. I like it there. That's why I try to be a model tenant."</p><p>I learn later that you have to have a permanent address to get on welfare.</p><p><a href="http://www.theaitch.com/">Don't forget the Aitch</a>.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-6342517562725089184?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
