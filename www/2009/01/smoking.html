<p>I haven't got much of Joseph's story yet, but I do know he lived in South Carolina before moving here.</p><p>It turns out he ran into trouble at his church down there because he smokes. It actually takes my wife and I a minute or two to realize what he is saying (as we're driving home from church). He's asking if we think he'll go to Hell for smoking.</p><p>"I don't drink or cuss or anything like that, but I can't seem to quit smoking."</p><p>"So you think you go to Hell for drinking or cussing?"</p><p>"Chad better hope not!" contributes my wife.</p><p>He's been afraid we'll kick him out of our church if we smell smoke on him.</p><p><a href="http://www.theaitch.com/">Don't forget the Aitch</a>.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-7221823763925411028?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
