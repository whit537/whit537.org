<p>I haven't got much of Joseph's story yet, but I do know he lived in South
Carolina before moving here.</p>

<p>It turns out he ran into trouble at his church down there because he smokes.
It actually takes my wife and I a minute or two to realize what he is saying
(as we're driving home from church). He's asking if we think he'll go to Hell
for smoking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't drink or cuss or anything like that, but I can't seem to quit
smoking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you think you go to Hell for drinking or cussing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chad better hope not!&rdquo; contributes my wife.</p>

<p>He's been afraid we'll kick him out of our church if we smell smoke on
him.</p>
