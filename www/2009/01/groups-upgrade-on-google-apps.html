Apparently this isn't big enough news for<a href="http://googleappsupdates.blogspot.com/search?q=groups">the Google Apps blog</a>, but the distribution list feature got an upgradein early December and <a href="http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?answer=126169&amp;topic=14869">is now called "groups."</a> There's a new member/owner distinction, and you can set up other list types than "Public."<div><br /></div><div><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2009/google-apps-new-groups.gif" /><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I've wanted this functionality since I started using distribution lists in Google Apps, so I'm happy. The obvious question is how this product relates to Google Groups. Will they ever converge? Would I want them to? Google Groups is pretty heavy.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-5970892662704496655?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
