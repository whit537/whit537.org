<p>The <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com//leaderboard">Netflix Prize has entered its end game</a>! The contest to improve Netflix's recommendation system by at least 10% started in late 2006, and earlier this evening I received this message (having registered a team at one point):</p><blockquote>As of the submission by team "BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos" on June 26, 2009 18:42:37 UTC, the Netflix Prize competition entered the "last call" period for the Grand Prize.  In accord with the Rules, teams have thirty (30) days, until July 26, 2009 18:42:37 UTC, to make submissions that will be considered for this Prize.  Good luck and thank you for participating!</blockquote><p>The <a href="http://pragmatictheory.blogspot.com/2009/06/whats-in-name.html">top two teams joined forces</a> a few days ago, and it seems that there was enough that was distinctive in each approach that combining their algorithms put them over the top. <a href="http://pragmatictheory.googlepages.com/progressgraph">The progress curve</a> had flattened, so even though 10.05% improvement is barely over the 10% target, it represents a big surge compared to recent months. Here's what a Netflix spokesman had to <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/06/winning-teams-join-to-qualify-for-1-million-netflix-prize">say</a>:</p><blockquote>This has been terribly exciting. It's like watching the Belmont Stakes, the Preakness and the Indie 500 all at onceâ€”for geeks.</blockquote><p>Yeah, that sounds about right. They have to publish their work as part of the rules; I'm really looking forward to seeing it. :-)</p><p>Good work and congratulations, <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~volinsky/netflix/bpc.html">BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos</a>!</p><p><i>Write-ups:</i> <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/and-the-winner-of-the-1-million-netflix-prize-probably-is/">New York Times</a>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/06/winning-teams-join-to-qualify-for-1-million-netflix-prize">Wired</a>.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-8403176688149183323?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
