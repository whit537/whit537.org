Likewise, nothing on the Internet is <i>truly</i> "interesting" or "authentic." Here, those words are baloney. Here, everything we do can only ever be tongue-in-cheek. If you claim otherwise, then I don't believe you. How can anything be more interesting or authentic than this?</p><p><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2009/passion.jpg" /><br /></p><p>Humans are the only thing worth <i>really</i> caring about. And I'm talking face-to-face, rich, messy, slow humans. Not pictures of them. Not videos of them. Not tweets from them. And I mean any single human, not just my kids. I mean the specific humans that are physically in front of me right now.</p><p>Are some <a href="http://www.joshklein.net/">websites worth caring about</a> more than others? Yes, of course. Are some <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/james_howard_kunstler_dissects_suburbia.html">public spaces worth caring about</a> more than others? Sure. But you do not have permission to refer the word "passion" to them. But look: tongue-in-cheek is ok. Websites and plazas can still be interesting, fun, and worthwhile to work on, and you should still try to design them for humans. You just can't be more passionate about them than the human in front of you right now.</p><p><i>P.S.</i> <a href="http://www.theaitch.com/">Don't Forget the Aitch</a> is a reminder for you and me, here on the Internet, of this fact.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-8682430677091151529?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
