<p>Gheat is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gheat/">a toolkit for heatmaps in Python</a>. I <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/07/heatmap-for-google-maps.html">started</a> the project two years ago, and <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2008/01/gheat-python-heatmap-for-google-maps.html">open-sourced</a> it 18 months ago. Gheat has seen modest uptake since then, and today I'm happy to announce the first two committers to the project.</p><p><b>David Zielezna</b> is an Australian developer who is active in the security visualization community. He is using gheat to <a href="http://www.confickerworkinggroup.org/wiki/pmwiki.php/ANY/InfectionDistribution">visualize the spread of the Conficker worm</a> as part of the Microsoft-sponsored <a href="http://www.confickerworkinggroup.org/">Conficker Working Group</a>. He has also introduced gheat to the <a href="http://www.honeynet.org.au/">Australian Honeynet Project</a> for <a href="http://www.honeynet.org.au/?q=node/41">tracking spam origins</a>.</p><p><b>Joshua Gross</b> is using gheat to map web page clicks as part of <a href="http://vistrac.com/">an analytics product called VisTrac</a>. VisTrac also provides form metrics, scroll metrics, and other features.</p><p>Thanks and welcome aboard, David and Joshua!</p><p>If you're also using gheat, I'd love to hear about it. If you're interested in heatmapping with Python, now is a great time to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gheat/">get involved with gheat</a>.</p><p><br /></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-5902374293217128546?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
