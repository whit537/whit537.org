We're headed to church where Mary has a class before services.<br /></p><p>She's bedecked in a black and white print skirt with a white jacket, while I'm doin' the seersucker, bowtied, Penguin cap thing.<br /></p><p>I park across from Starbuck's. We cross the street and let this dog-walking couple pass&mdash;the guy sporting amajestic white great dane; as Mary goes in for coffee,I head off to Cafe Des Amis for a croissant.<br /></p><p>From behind, I recognize the blonde; he's an afterthought.<br /></p><p>So I say, "Hey! Wadya think of that <a href="http://www2.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2008030223">game last night</a>?"<br /></p><p>They slow, and now walking backwards, he says, "Great game! You?"<br /></p><p>Turning the corner, I reply, "I don't know about you guys, but these one goal games are killin' me."</p><p>Natalie laughs; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Lemieux">Mario</a> shakes his head and smiles.</p><p></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-6668531764694642675?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
