<p></p><p>When Gmail came out, it had a clear story even if some people didn't like it: Email without folders. Google Wave attempts to be a much more disruptive technology, and&mdash;perhaps fittingly&mdash;my first impression is one of disorientation. I'm struggling to connect.</p><p><b>Am I composing an email?</b> I have a three-pane layout with an inbox and a contact list, but there are other people editing at the same time as I am. There's no time to "compose" here.</p><p><b>Am I building a shared document?</b> I have a document canvas with rich widgets, but it's rather cramped, and these documents are awkwardly splintered into subdocuments, and it's unclear whether I am building something long-lived or ephemeral.</p><p><b>Am I chatting?</b> Others are editing in real-time, but there is no continuous stream. Do I answer their question inline, in a response, in a subdocument, or in a new Wave?</p><p>This high-level mental fog is mirrored in the UI. Whether in email, documents, or chat, I expect to be able to just click somewhere and start typing. But with Wave there are extra steps that I still haven't internalized yet. Do I right click? Select and (right?) click? Click a little menu dropdown? Click in the thin little space to start a new reply? Or should I inline-reply? Now how do I do that again? Gah! Meanwhile, others are editing in real time, adding to the feeling of pressure.</p><p>I can see a few scenarios:</p><p></p><ul><li>I'm just a slow adopter here. Once the network effect kicks in and I spend enough time with it, I'll "get it," and Wave will feel as normal as email/chat/facebook.</li><li>Perhaps, in response to mixed initial reviews, Google will evolve the product quickly into something either more familiar or at least more coherent.</li><li>On the other hand, it could be that while Google has stirred up the pot, the real innovation in fundamental Internet communication will come from left field.</li></ul><p></p><p>I agree that there is room for <i>something</i> by way of a communications [r]evolution, but I'm not sure Wave is it. Wave doesn't feel accidental enough to be revolutionary. Though even if the real winner comes from left field, Google isn't ruled out: remember that they had already invested in Google Video when they bought YouTube.</p><p>For the time being, I see myself checking in on Wave occasionally, but sticking with Gmail, chat, and <a href="http://etherpad.com/">EtherPad</a> for day to day communication.</p><p>You?</p><p></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-6292186236707856059?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
