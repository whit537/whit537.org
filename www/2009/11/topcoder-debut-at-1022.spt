<p><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/">TopCoder</a> is the major league of competition programming, and  apparently it's also <a href="http://blog.theroyweb.com/using-topcoder-to-improve-programming-skills">the best way to study for interviews with software companies</a>. Today, after a week or two of practice, I competed in my first TopCoder event. I got my butt kicked.</p><p>The main event is the fortnightly Algorithm Single Round Match (SRM). About 1500 people, mostly students from China, India, and Russia, compete in chatrooms of 20 each. The competition entails a 75 minute "coding phase" where you solve three programming problems (easy: 250 points, medium: 500, hard: 1000), and then 15 minutes of trying to crash each others' programs ("challenge phase"). Lastly, everyones' programs are subjected to extensive "system tests". If you fail a challenge or system test, you lose all points for that problem. Points tick down once you open a problem, so speed-to-correct-program is the key.</p><p>I finished the easy problem in a barely respectable 10 minutes (for ~238 points), and started in on the medium problem. I sketched the algorithm properly on paper, but during implementation got bogged down in a) type conversions in C++, and b) edge cases. I ultimately failed to submit the medium problem within 65 minutes of opening it; I never opened the hard problem. For comparison, the fastest time for a correct answer to the medium problem was <i>4 minutes and 12 seconds</i>. During the challenge phase, I challenged someone just to feel what it felt like (the failed challenge cost me 25 points, but what did I have to lose?). System tests ran about 20 minutes, and within another 10 minutes, the website had been updated to reflect the results of the match.</p><p>Every competitor has a rating, and there are two divisions. The ratings are basically <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/wiki/display/tc/Algorithm+Competition+Rating+System">given on a curve</a>, though it's unclear to me how they relate to the problem point values. I expected a rating of 213 (238 - 25), but came out with <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=22846168">a rating of 1022</a>! This puts me within arms' reach of Division 1, which starts at 1200. The current top coder is rated 3766. He started 4 years ago at 1067, and was in the top tier (>2200) within 3 months.</p><p>I had a lot of fun competing in TopCoder. Moreover, I can definitely see that doing well here would involve my becoming a better programmer. The next SRM is on December 5. I can't wait!</p><p></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-4837384204652026661?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
