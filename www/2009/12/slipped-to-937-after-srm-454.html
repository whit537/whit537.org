<p>Geez, same story as <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2009/11/topcoder-debut-at-1022.html">last time</a>. I got the easy problem done in about 10 minutes, and was two edge cases away from submitting the medium problem. But I didn't make it, and now I'm down t<span><span>o percentile 50.3894. *sigh*</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; white-space: pre; "></span></p><p>One thing that tripped me up was that I put a print statement in the wrong place on the easy problem, in an inner loop. This hosed my TopCoder client and I had to kill the client and log back in. That cost me a precious minute or so.</p><p>The bigger problem was that I didn't immediately recognize that "swap" is code for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">bubble sort</a> in the problem statement. Bubble sort is rarely recommended for real-world use, but of course that's no excuse.</p><p>I tried another challenge, this time for real. Each program has 2 seconds to run or it gets ruled out as "time limit exceeded," or TLE. I tried to construct a maximal test case for the medium problem, but it wasn't big enough. Probably as a general rule, TLE attacks aren't going to work except on the harder problems. But, again, had I recognized this as bubble sort, I would have constructed a better test case than I did.</p><p>Next match is December 17. Maybe I'll try doing the medium problem first.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-3716823307376373602?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
