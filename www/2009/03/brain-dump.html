<p></p><div>The purpose of this post is to clarify both for myself and for those close to me what I think of myself as "working on." Here is a brain dump. </div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">I. Village:</span></div><ol><li>I would like to say out loud and first that nothing makes me happier than my children.<br /></li><li>About my wife, I would like to say that Jessica and I are each other.<br /></li><li>I want to never leave this neighborhood. I want to "tend" it like Wendell Berry wants you to tend a farm. I want to die at 22 Lenzman Ct.</li><li>I am a part of (a) the Whitacres, (b) the Lloyds.</li><li>I have friends, here and there.</li></ol><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Village Projects:</span></div><ul><li>Keep chickens.<br /></li><li>Don't forget the aitch.<br /></li><li>Play music.<br /></li><li>Make the farmer's market.<br /></li><li>Grow raspberries.<br /></li><li>Finish our fence/basement/garage.<br /></li><li>Plant lots of beech trees.<br /></li><li>Pick up garbage.<br /></li><li>Start a 3-room schoolhouse.</li><li>Etc., forever.<br /></li></ul><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">II. World:</span></div><ol><li>Participate in metaphysics (Sider, Chalmers, Paul, etc.).<br /></li><li>Build Bibligon, so I can read the Bible (Koran, etc.).<br /></li><li>Establish XMin? (what is this? who is the audience? TBD, pending I, II.1, &amp; II.2).<br /></li><li>Integrate metaphysics work, reading of holy books, and settled ecclesiology (rehabilitation of Kant, metaphysical basis of theology, interpersonalist ethic, etc.).<br /></li></ol><div>Assumption, Big: Internet and airplanes mean I can do Village <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic; ">and</span> World.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">III. Therefore:</span></div><ol><li>Succeed in business, but only for the sake of enabling Village + World (but still really succeed, somehow).</li><li>Succeed in open source, but only because I'm already into it with (a) Aspen and (b) gheat; I want them to succeed and not fail. And I like the people; I miss PyCon. FOSS is tied to business for me. Business means web (for me), and web means Aspen (for me).</li></ol><div>That, for what it's worth, is the state of my brain. I believe that 99% of my daily thought life falls within this categorization. Eleven items in three categories, plus Village Projects. If you who know me see me flip-flopping and pursuing something different every day or two, try as an exercise placing my current "whim" somewhere within this taxonomy. I want (of course) to think that my whims fit into a coherent whole.</div><p></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-4613889473404437884?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
