<p>The purpose of this post is to clarify both for myself and for those close
to me what I think of myself as "working on." Here is a brain dump.</p>
    
<h2>I. Village:</h2>

<ol>

    <li>I would like to say out loud and first that nothing makes me happier
    than my children.</li>

    <li>About my wife, I would like to say that Jessica and I are each
    other.</li>

    <li>I want to never leave this neighborhood. I want to "tend" it like
    Wendell Berry wants you to tend a farm. I want to die at 22 Lenzman
    Ct.</li>

    <li>I am a part of (a) the Whitacres, (b) the Lloyds.</li>

    <li>I have friends, here and there.</li>
        
</ol>
        
<h2>Village Projects:</h2>

<ul>

    <li>Keep chickens.</li>

    <li>Don't forget the aitch.</li>

    <li>Play music.</li>

    <li>Make the farmer's market.</li>

    <li>Grow raspberries.</li>

    <li>Finish our fence/basement/garage.</li>

    <li>Plant lots of beech trees.</li>

    <li>Pick up garbage.</li>

    <li>Start a 3-room schoolhouse.</li>

    <li>Etc., forever.</li>
    
</ul>

<h2>II. World:</h2>
    
<ol>

    <li>Participate in metaphysics (Sider, Chalmers, Paul, etc.).</li>

    <li>Build Bibligon, so I can read the Bible (Koran, etc.).</li>

    <li>Establish XMin? (what is this? who is the audience?  TBD, pending I,
    II.1, &amp; II.2).</li>

    <li>Integrate metaphysics work, reading of holy books, and settled
    ecclesiology (rehabilitation of Kant, metaphysical basis of theology,
    interpersonalist ethic, etc.).</li>
        
</ol>
        
<p>Assumption, Big: Internet and airplanes mean I can do Village <i>and</i>
World.</p>
        
        <h2>III. Therefore:</h2>

    <li>Succeed in business, but only for the sake of enabling Village + World
    (but still really succeed, somehow).</li>

    <li>Succeed in open source, but only because I'm already into it with (a)
    Aspen and (b) gheat; I want them to succeed and not fail. And I like the
    people; I miss PyCon. FOSS is tied to business for me. Business means web
    (for me), and web means Aspen (for me).</li>
    
</ol>
    
<p>That, for what it's worth, is the state of my brain. I believe that 99% of
my daily thought life falls within this categorization. Eleven items in three
categories, plus Village Projects. If you who know me see me flip-flopping and
pursuing something different every day or two, try as an exercise placing my
current "whim" somewhere within this taxonomy. I want (of course) to think that
my whims fit into a coherent whole.</p>
