<p>I've been working through an <a href="http://www.fecundity.com/logic/">introductory logic textbook</a> called <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">forall x</span>. It's liberally licensed and I bought it through Lulu. It's great. I love it. I'm on the exercises for the second-to-last chapter. I might finish in a month or two, though already I feel more confident. The other day I dipped back into <a href="http://www.bracil.net/edward/FCS.html"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Foundations of Constraint Satisfaction</span></a> and also into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199241465"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Parts</span></a>, and I wasn't <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">completely</span> lost in the symbolic logic.</p><p>Now I've found what looks like the perfect follow-on:<a href="http://tedsider.org/books/lfp.html"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Logic for Philosophy</span></a> by <a href="http://tedsider.org/">Ted Sider</a>. Here's how chapter one opens:</p><p></p><blockquote><p>Since you are reading this book, you probably know some logic already.You probably know how to translate English sentences into symbolicnotation, into propositional logic[,]and into predicate logic[.]You are probably also familiar with some techniques for evaluating argumentswritten out in symbolic notation. You have probably encountered truth tables,and some form of proof theory (perhaps a &ldquo;natural deduction&rdquo; system; perhaps&ldquo;truth trees&rdquo;.) You may have even encountered some elementary model theory.In short: you have taken an introductory course in symbolic logic.</p><p>What you already possess is: literacy in elementary logic. What you willget out of this book is: literacy in the rest of logic that philosophers tend topresuppose, plus a deeper grasp of what logic is all about.</p></blockquote><p>Bingo! Another enticing quote, fromthe preface:</p><p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"></span></p><p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"></span></p><p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal;"><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic; "><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal; ">[This book] preparesstudents to read the logically sophisticated articles in today&rsquo;s philosophyjournals, and helps them resist bullying by symbol-mongerers. In short, itteaches the logic you need to know in order to be a contemporary philosopher.</span></span></blockquote></span></p><p></p><p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Logic for Philosophy</span> doesn't appear to be liberally licensed, but <a href="http://tedsider.org/books/lfp.html">the draft is available as a PDF</a>. Works for me.</p><p>In related news, David Lewis' <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0631224262">On the Plurality of Worlds</a></span> is in the mail. So here I am, slowly chipping away at figuring out <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2008/10/next-stop-langton-and-lewis-on-humility.html">why philosophy has forgotten about Kant</a>.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-243296964684377195?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
