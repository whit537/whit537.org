<p><a href="http://www.u2.com/">U2</a> just put out a new album, <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">No Line on the Horizon</span>. This is their seventh <a href="http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/albums_index.jsp">chart</a>-topper in the States, which ties them with Led Zeppelin for second place. (The Beatles have 19; not popular, seminal.) You can listen to the <a href="http://mrns.u2.com/secure_api/u2player.php?vendor_id=692&amp;media_id=14760&amp;channel_id=6139&amp;e=1237003838&amp;h=2903aa65e93c278232d97e26812a428e">entire album online</a>. Wow, the music industry is changing. But then you listen to it. Yawn! It's 1998 all over again. They're old and the songs are flat.</p><p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/kutiman">Kutiman</a> also just put out a new album. It's also available <a href="http://www.thru-you.com/#/videos/">online for free</a>. Unlike U2 and Led Zeppelin, Kutiman has no chart-topping albums. But unlike U2's album, which I gave up on after the fourth song, I've listened to <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Thru You</span> about 10 times in the past two days. It's so human.</p><p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/i88CKr6Shn4&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/i88CKr6Shn4&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-6285361955291637358?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
