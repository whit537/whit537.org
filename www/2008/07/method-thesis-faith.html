I've been proceeding with my <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/11/philosophical-agenda.html">philosophical agenda</a>. You'll recall that a few months ago I settled on <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2008/04/next-mereological-overlaps-and-kant.html">mereology and Kant</a> as the next steps. I'm still waiting for Steve to dig <span style="font-style: italic;">Parts</span> out of his basement, but in the mean time I've read Descartes (<span style="font-style: italic;">Discourse</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Meditations</span>), and I just finished Hume's <span style="font-style: italic;">Enquiry</span> (with the <span style="font-style: italic;">Letter from a Gentleman</span> and the <span style="font-style: italic;">Abstract</span>) this morning.<br /><br />Descartes and Hume both have key insights on which they base their philosophies. Descartes has his 4-step method, and Hume his tracing of ideas to impressions. The method I'm interested to establish is the application of <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">the principle of abstraction</a>, which is that there is a trade-off between detail and power in moving between levels of scale. Mereology and epistemology are fields within which to establish this method.<br /><br />My current thesis is that these early modern philosophers—Descartes and Hume, as well as Locke, Berkeley, Kant—approach agreement as each approaches the thing he is most certain about; and abstraction accounts for this fact. In other words, the following concepts are roughly synonymous:<br /><ul><li>Descartes' <span style="font-style: italic;">cogito, ergo sum</span></li><li>Locke's <span style="font-style: italic;">intuitions</span><br /></li><li>Berkeley's <span style="font-style: italic;">perceptions</span></li><li>Hume's <span style="font-style: italic;">impressions</span></li><li>Kant's <span style="font-style: italic;">phenomena</span></li></ul>They are similar, and <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">abstraction</a> accounts for the differences. This is tentative without reading Kant; I'll start the <span style="font-style: italic;">Prolegomena</span> this afternoon on the bus, and I still hope to get in that class this fall.<br /><br />One significant side-effect: it turns out that Hume is not nearly as antagonistic to faith as usually portrayed. I've seen this quote before:<br /><blockquote>When we run over libraries, persuaded of [my new] principles, what havoc must we make? If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, <span style="font-style: italic;">Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?</span> No. <span style="font-style: italic;">Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence?</span> No. Commit it then to the flames: For it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.</blockquote>That's the last paragraph of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Enquiry</span>. The inference I've generally seen drawn is that <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> "divinity" is worthless, "nothing but sophistry and illusion". But two paragraphs earlier, we read:<br /><blockquote>Divinity or Theology, as it proves the existence of a Deity, and the immortality of souls, is composed partly of reasonings concerning particulars, partly concerning general facts. It has a foundation in <span style="font-style: italic;">reason</span>, so far as it is supported by experience. But its best and most solid foundation is <span style="font-style: italic;">faith</span> and divine revelation.</blockquote>In other words, Hume very much thinks that there is such a thing as divinity which  <span style="font-style: italic;">does</span> contain experimental reasoning. He's not against theology; he's against <span style="font-style: italic;">bad</span> theology. Moreover, it's pretty clear from the rest of the book that "<span style="font-style: italic;">faith</span> and divine revelation" are not negative categories for Hume. After all, his whole project is to show that reason has limits, that reason in fact has no rational basis. So I don't think he is even really against devotional literature, so long as it doesn't masquerade as philosophy. Hume is against pride, not faith.
