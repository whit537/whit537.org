This is number 2 in the <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2008/03/new-series-adventure.html">Adventure!</a> series: it turns out that sometimes adventure is in your own back yard.<br /><br />Back in February, Bishop Duncan (my boss's boss) used his monthly column in <a href="http://www.pghanglican.org/news/trinity/">Trinity magazine</a> to run a prophecy received from an English priest, The Rev. Mark Stibbe. It is entitled "The Year of the Gate," and my favorite line is this:<br /><blockquote>2008 is the year of the gate... And there is a BREAKER ANOINTING on those who are pushing up to the threshold of their opportunity.</blockquote>This prophecy and an hour of googling opened my eyes to the world of charismatic Christianity. Now I subscribe to the <a href="http://elijahlist.com/">ElijahList</a> and periodically follow a lead from there, as a way to learn about the side of my religion that I'm least familiar with. This morning I ended up on the <a href="http://www.extremeprophetic.com/">Extreme Prophetic</a> website, on the <a href="http://www.extremeprophetic.com/articles_teachings_extreme_moments_video.htm">videos page</a>, where I found <a href="http://www.extremeprophetic.com/videoplay.php?id=http://www.propheticmedia.com/video/video_email_media/2008/2_29_08_Weblist_08_BreakerAnointing_PatriciaKingHIGH.mp4">a video</a> on the subject of the Breaker Anointing. It's a 16 minute video, but check out this 3-minute excerpt:<br /><br /><object height="350" width="425"> <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/WER74TDgVVk">  <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/WER74TDgVVk" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="350" width="425"></embed>  </object><br /><br />When I first saw this, I was floored. I think I've watched it 15 times since then. I seriously can't get over it.<br /><br />First of all, it's so <span style="font-style: italic;">erotic</span>. I mean, the way she keeps convulsing uncontrollably, tightening her eyes and moaning, "Whoa!" And then when she shakes her head: "... to our <span style="font-style: italic;">ministry</span> right now." Followed by the afterglow, straightening back, shivers, sunshine,"Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Oh <span style="font-style: italic;">WOW!!</span>" It makes me blush!<br /><br />Secondly, it's that weird mix of "give me money," and "God is blessing our ministry." I can't say that she's manipulative or malicious because I think she believes it. Deceived would be the strongest I could muster.<br /><br />But even so, I certainly get excited at times, even to the point of exclaiming outloud (and I'm not talking about, um, marriage). A big part of the difference is the language, the story that explains the phenomenon. I call it "getting pumped," not "being visited by the Breaker Angel."<br /><br />Oh man this is such an iceberg: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USxFMLKC59E">gold dust</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au4ooZYIkZI">gemstones</a>, and "<a href="http://www.charismamag.com/display.php?id=14681">there is a sound in the shofar that breaks things and releases things in the spirit realm.</a>"<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-8650541396138486562?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
