Ok, I had to take a break from the Internet there for a month, but now it appears I'm back. And I'm back with a game!<br /><br />The game is to guess what this is a picture of:<br /><br /><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2008/guess/00.jpg" /><br /><br />I'll post a new version of the picture every so often until one of you guesses right. Then we'll talk about the reason behind the game (bonus points if you guess that too).<br /><br />(P.S. If you're reading this on Facebook, could I ask you to post your comments <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2008/02/guessing-game.html">back on my blog</a>? For the pre-Facebook neanderthals among us, you understand ...)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-162135634107244655?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
