Sam was tongue tied (his frenulum linguae, the vertical flap of skin under his tongue, was too tight), and he's old enough to kick, so this morning we woke up at 5:00 and took him down to UPMC Children's Hospital to have his frenulum snipped. Some facts:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Total Time from Car to Car:</span> 2 hrs., 15 mins.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Total Number of Rooms:</span> 6<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Total Number of People:</span> 18+<br /></blockquote>I am thankful for UPMC Children's Hospital. It's a giant crazy system and so you go in knowing that. But I was overwhelmed at how many people it took to snip a frenulum. Here, in order, are the people that formally represented UPMC Children's Hospital to us in the course of 2.25 hours:<br /><ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Anonymous Parking-lot Attendant</span> (directed us to the right garage)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Anonymous Sign-in Lady #1</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Anonymous Sign-in Lady #2</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Denise</span> (nurse that took us back to the exam room)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Jeff</span> (Patient Care Technician [PCT], took Sam's vitals)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kathy</span> (Nurse Practioner [NP], prepped us for his anesthesia)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fr. John</span> (our priest, not employed by UPMC of course but definitely playing a role in the system)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Donnalee</span> (Registered Nurse [NP], reviewed Sam's medical history; answered lots of annoying questions from me about her wheely computer cart&mdash;"Is it like whoever gets here first gets the best cart?" Her mouse kept falling off.)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Heather</span> (Patient Support Assistant [PSA]&mdash;escorted us upstairs)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cindy</span> (maitre'd at the PCU; don't know what it stands for but the PCU is the operation room holding area for first-time surgery patients)<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Christina</span> (PCU nurse that told us what to do and whisked us away while they carried Sam screaming to the operating room)<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr. Mohammed</span> (anesthesiology resident)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr. Roosen</span> (anesthesiologist)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr. Anonymous </span>(other anesthesiology resident)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr. Felder</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>the guy doing the operation; pediatric otolaryngologist [infant ear/nose/throat doc])</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Carol</span> (waiting room nurse)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Amy</span> (PCT, escorted us to the exit after Sam was done)</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Donna</span> (parking cashier)<br /></li></ol>Wow! That's 7.5 minutes per person, not counting all of the other people in the operating room that Jess and I didn't meet (they wouldn't let me back there). Actually snipping the frenulum took under 5 seconds.<br /><br />Being manhandled through giant machines can really suck. For me, understanding how <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">abstractions</a> work does a few things:<br /><ul><li>It relieves anxiety.</li><li>It empowers me to ask questions and "push back" when needed.</li><li>It turns the experience into one of overwhelming fascination.<br /></li></ul>I am fascinated at the complexity of the system&mdash;and it actually more or less works!&mdash;but also at the human moments along the way. Example: of all the people in the PCU, Dr. Felder, a practicing Jew, singled out Dr. Mohammed for a cordial handshake and greeting. My dad's comment: "Maybe they play bluegrass together." :^)<br /><br />And as complex as the system is when you're inside it, even it is just a single opaque item&mdash;"UPMC"&mdash;when looking at the larger systems it itself fits into:<br /><ul><li>UPMC is <a href="http://www.upmc.com/AboutUPMC/AUHome/TheUPMCStory/">the largest employer in Western PA</a>.</li><li>UPMC is <a href="http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/best-hospitals/directory/hospital.php?id=6232430">#13 in the US News rankings</a>.</li><li>UPMC is <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05363/629309.stm">the "dominant relationship" in a man's life</a>.</li></ul>The tension is that, because abstraction by <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">definition</a> means trading individuality at lower levels for efficiency at higher levels, I'm not sure whether you can ever have the benefits of abstraction without its drawbacks. A higher standard of living <span style="font-style: italic;">requires</span> impersonal beast systems. I think. Maybe. No?<br /><br />And if I'm right about abstractions, then the question to ask is not primarily, "How can we replace beast systems with human systems?" but more like, "How can we reimplement lower-level, raw, more-human systems as layers <span style="font-style: italic;">on top of</span> impersonal beast systems?" Eh?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-2215196153799062487?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
