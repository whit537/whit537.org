I asked earlier about <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2008/08/experimental-philosophy-metaphysics-goo.html">artificial intelligence and metaphysics</a>, and in exploring CMU's graduate programs, it looks like they have this covered from <a href="http://www.hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/research-mind.php">both</a> <a href="http://www.ml.cmu.edu/prospective_students/phd.html">sides</a>. But now that I think about it, I had it backwards <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2008/08/experimental-philosophy-metaphysics-goo.html">last time</a>: understanding how humans work is interesting, but understanding where we fit within reality as a whole is bigger for me.<br /><br />Really what I want to do is develop and test my hypothesis that <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/realm.html">the physical realm arises out of the spiritual as the mental out of the physical</a>. What does Googlebot see when it looks at a transistor? How does that compare with what we see when we observe quarks? So really it's the intersection of computer science, philosophy, religion, and physics that I'm after.<br /><br />If I'm honest, I'm trying to test Christianity.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-7823723788153513939?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
