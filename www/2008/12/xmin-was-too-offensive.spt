Only in a select few texts does Christ get crucified. There is no evidence that these particular texts are in any way true (unless your evidence is that a rich oligarchy compiled them into the Bible).</div><div><br /></div><div>I believe it is most likely that Christ did not die on the cross, but one of the many people impersonating him did. Impersonation is one of the main explanations used by modern churches for biblical texts that aren't in the Bible. However, it is also an explanation to many of the texts that are IN the Bible.</div><div><br /></div><div>Just because I follow the example of Christ does not mean I follow the cross-bearing corporations trying to make money off him.</div></blockquote><div>Sorry!
