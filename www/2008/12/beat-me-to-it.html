Here's another <a href="http://www.relspace.astahost.com/minimal.html">expression of Christian Minimalism</a> which is similar to <a href="http://xmin.org/">mine</a>:<div><blockquote>The basic idea behind christian minimalism, as I am defining it, is that what we truly and honestly know for certain is very little indeed [...]. Acknowledging this fact the christian minimalist commits himself only to those tenets of christianity which express the root of his own faith, and in everything else, hedges his opinions with a plea of ignorance.</blockquote></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-90214345504499457?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
