A couple days ago at work we announced our <a href="http://www.united-anglicans.org/about/provisional-constitution.html">new constitution</a>. This was a big milestone for us. However, seeing this out there solidifies for me that I'm not going to ratify the XMin Constitution that I <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2008/11/constitution-of-christian-minimalism.html">released a couple weeks ago</a>.<div><br /></div><div><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2008/xmin.png" alt="Christian Minimalism" /><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>You'll recall that before that, XMin had been merely an FAQ in which all the answers are "undefined." The difference between the undefined XMin and the XMin Constitution is the difference between a free web service and a very cheap web service: seemingly small, but actually huge. The $5/mo web service might as well cost $50/mo. An XMin with a constitution might as well be the Catholic Church.</div><div><br /></div><div>So there you have it. Experiment failed. Will <a href="http://xmin.org/">the new old XMin</a> fare any better? Undefined.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-4576793246876951537?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
