<div>I started out writing websites in ASP. Then I got into Zope. From there I went to Plone. Then Django came along. What I learned from this bouncing around (and, for you non-geeks, the names don't really need to mean much for you to get my point), is that life is about finding a place on the stack. You pick a field (a subculture, a shared mental realm), and you dive into the middle of it, anywhere. Then you explore. You push up and down the stack. What's below me? What's above me? When you have your bearings, you take stock. What am I here to accomplish? Where do I need to be on the stack in order to accomplish what I want to accomplish? As far as web programming goes, I've needed to bang out a bunch of little websites pretty quickly to make money. Over the years I've settled into a toolset including Python, Django, Aspen, Subversion, Apache, and FreeBSDâ€”tools I can take more or less for granted, and use as black boxes to get stuff done.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://xmin.org/">Christian Minimalism</a> is where I want to be on the culture stack. My project is inviting Christians to be more human, and humans to be more Christian. Christian Minimalism is a thing I can take for granted, a dependency, a foundation I can build on in pursuing these twin goals. I like it.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-6126582747037112097?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
