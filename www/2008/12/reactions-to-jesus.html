I can think of 6 reactions to Jesus:<div><ol><li>Jesus was evil.</li><li>Jesus was a nice fairy tale.</li><li>Jesus was a wise man.</li><li>Jesus was a prophet from God.</li><li>Jesus was a divine being.<br /></li><li>Jesus was the Second Person of the Trinity.</li></ol><div>Am I missing any?</div><div><br /></div><div>Christian Minimalism exists to subsume all of these positions under the heading of "Christianity." Yes, I can imagine someone who thinks that Jesus was evil but considers themselves Christian. And therefore that person exists. And that person is in the same religion that I am in, if they want to be.</div><div><br /></div><div>I am willing to be identified with any human.</div><div><br /></div><div>I am willing for any human to identify me with any other human.</div></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-5273284348051861781?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
