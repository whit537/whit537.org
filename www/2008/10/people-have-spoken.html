<div>Wikipedia knows <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2008/10/theory-of-distinction.html">what I'm talking about</a>:<blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinction">Distinction</a></span>, the fundamental philosophical abstraction, involves the recognition of two or more things being distinct, i.e. different.</blockquote></div><div></div><span><span><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">Abstraction</a></span> is the process or result of generalization by reducing the information content of a concept or an observable phenomenon, typically in order to retain only information which is relevant for a particular purpose. For example, abstracting a leather soccer ball to a ball retains only the information on general ball attributes and behaviour. Similarly, abstracting happiness to an emotional state reduces the amount of information conveyed about the emotional state.</blockquote>I exchanged some emails with Profs. <a href="http://www.tedsider.org/">Sider</a> and <a href="http://www.lapaul.org/">Paul</a>, and they tell me that Kant's metaphysics are out of favor these days. So now I'm on a quest to find out why.</span></span><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-6601687030428531389?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
