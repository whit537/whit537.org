<div>My friends know that I oscillate pretty regularly between geek and luddite. Why, I wonder?</div><div><br /></div><div>Let's start with <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">realm</span>. To recap quickly, a realm is <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/realm.html">a venue of human existence</a>, and there are three of them:</div><div><ul><li>mental<br /></li><li>physical<br /></li><li>spiritual<br /></li></ul></div><div><div>The mental realm is where we live out our conscious life. Consciousness is a thing (me) that processes experience. Experience is <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">of</span>mental things and physical things.Experience is made possible by certain hardwired features of consciousness, namely space and time, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_(Kant)">quantity, quality, relation, and modality</a>. The mental realm arises out of the physical insofar as consciousness depends on the brain for its functioning. This "arising" is a direct connection between the two: <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">X</span>configuration of brain matter/energy correlates to <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Y</span>state of consciousness. There is also an indirect connection insofar as mental objects&mdash;my concept of the desk&mdash;correlate to physical objects&mdash;the desk.</div><div><br /></div><div>The physical realm is all the stuff that is indirectly accessible to consciousness via experience. Science is the process of exploring the physical realm.</div><div><br /></div><div>The spiritual realm is all the stuff that isn't even <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">indirectly</span> accessible to consciousness, like possible worlds and/or God. The best parallel to science we have for the spiritual realm is death, and even that's a crap-shoot.</div><div><br /></div><div>Ok, so that's realm.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, culture is like <a href="http://www.ultimatecitrus.com/oj.html">orange juice</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2008/fcoj.jpg" alt="Culture!" /><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>The authors of culture are the orange groves. Their ideas are picked, squeezed, dehydrated, frozen, shipped, stored, and sold. The consumers of culture take those little canisters of culture concentrate and reconstitute them as ideas in their own leafy brains.Books, blog posts, YouTube videos, stone tablets, Chick tracts, talking&mdash;all media are means of persisting and/or transmitting mental objects from one consciousness to another. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; ">Culture</span> is the <span class="Apple-style-span" style=""><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic; ">collective mental realm</span></span> that results. Constructing this shared mental realm is what humans do.</div><div><br /></div><div>Also, people are like sentient pixels.</div><div><br /></div><div><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2008/pixel.gif" alt="Mr. Pixel" /><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>They need to fit into some larger picture or they get seriously depressed.</div><div><br /></div><div><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2008/pixel.sad.gif" alt="Mr. Pixel, seriously depressed" /><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Culture is the larger picture that people fit into that makes them happy.</div><div><br /></div><div><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2008/pixel.placed.gif" alt="Mr. Pixel, happy" /><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Now we get into <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">scale</a>. All people are both authors and consumers of culture. And in between person and culture is a soupy mishmash of subcultures. Culture, subcultures, and people all affect and are affected by each other.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Sorry people, I'm out of time ...</div></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-3555915573909960126?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
