Before it gets too stale, I should let you know about <a href="http://lightmode.zetadev.com/">Lightmode</a>, a quasimode UI for the web. I cleaned it up last January for the <a href="http://humanized.com/">Humanized</a> <a href="http://humanized.com/weblog/">blog</a>, but then those guys got <a href="http://humanized.com/weblog/2008/01/16/joining-mozilla/">distracted</a> and it was never published there. :^)<br /><br /><a href="http://lightmode.zetadev.com/"><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2008/lightmode.gif" alt="" a="" quasimode="" ui="" for="" the="" web="" /></a><br /><br />The weirdest part is the way the big green "Ready" indicator flies to the opposite corner when you mouse over it. I did that because otherwise it prevents you from clicking on anything underneath it. I think you get used to it pretty quickly. Incidentally, the web apps in the demo are <a href="http://www.zetadev.com/software/aspen/">Aspen</a> exercises.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-212391665424357436?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
