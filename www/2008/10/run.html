I ran the Applefest 5K again this year. Aaron and Jess didn't run, though there was a guy dressed as a banana. I bested my time from <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/10/run.html">last year</a> by <a href="http://runhigh.com/2008%20Results/2008%20Results%20B/R100408BB.html">5 seconds</a>, which was still slower than the banana.<br /><br />*shrug*<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-4711036403762469424?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
