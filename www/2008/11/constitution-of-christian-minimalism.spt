Today at work we <a href="http://www.united-anglicans.org/stream/2008/11/draft-constitution.html">announced the draft constitution</a> for the new church we are putting together. This has inspired me to draft<strike><a href="http://xmin.org/constitution/">a constitution for Christian Minimalism</a></strike> <b>Update:</b> I've <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2008/12/xmin-reversion.html">retired the constitution</a> and reverted to the "Undefined" FAQ.<br /><br /><a href="http://xmin.org/constitution/"><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2008/xmin.png" alt="XMin" /></a><br /><br />The Rule of Life is my favorite part. As far as I know, no individual or household has yet ratified the Christian Minimalism constitution. If any do, I'd love to hear about it.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-8602385784290594667?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
