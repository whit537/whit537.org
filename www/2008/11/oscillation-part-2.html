To <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2008/10/oscillation-part-1.html">review</a> ... Three realms: mental, physical, spiritual. Mental is where life happens. Culture is a shared mental realm; cultural artifacts are like frozen orange juice. People are sentient pixels; pictures make us happy.<br /><br />Next question: ethics. Where does <span style="font-style: italic;">ought</span> come from?<br /><br />Everything I know about the shared mental realm of culture, the physical realm, and the spiritual realm—it all exists to me only ever in my personal, private mental realm. And it's all flat. Every mental object is fundamentally the same as another, just like every computer file is "really just" a bit-pattern.<div><br /></div><div>Take the following picture of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna">Lena Söderberg</a>.<br /><br /><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2008/lena.jpg" alt="Lena" /><br /><br />This image is from a <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic; ">Playboy </span>centerfold, and since the early 1970's it has been a standard sample image in technical work on image processing. Clearly, this image has a dense mat of cultural meanings.

All my reactions to it are "really just" mental objects. All my value judgments about it are "really just" mental objects. The value judgment implicit in the phrase "really just" is "really just" a mental object. Like everything else, ethics is "really just" a mental object.<br /><br />So if the mental realm is fundamentally flat, where does ethics come from?<br /><br />When you <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/pc3.htm">start a computer</a>, you have a chain reaction of simpler systems starting more complex ones, where a <span style="font-weight: bold;">system</span> is <span style="font-style: italic;">a set of processes</span>. Very roughly, whenever power is applied to the computer, it takes the bit-pattern stored in its first memory slot, and runs it. This first bit-pattern finds another bit-pattern on the hard drive, and runs that. Etc., etc., until eventually the computer is running a bit-pattern called "Firefox" to display a bit-pattern called "YouTube."<br /><br />When you wake up in the morning, something in your subconscious is triggering a whole set of processes—space/time, quantity, quality, relation, modality—that together constitute consciousness. To continue the analogy, consciousness is our operating system. Culture is what we do with it. Culture is our MS Office, our iLife, and our Firefox. It's also our spreadsheets, our videos, and our lena.jpg.<br /><br />Now we're approaching David Chalmers' <a href="http://consc.net/consc-papers.html">hard problem of consciousness</a>: what are the subconscious processes that bootstrap consciousness, and how did they get there? I'm going to hang a louie, however.<br /><br />Where does <span style="font-style: italic;">identity</span> come from?<br /><br />Consciousness is not identity. Identity—personhood—comes from participation in a culture, in a shared mental realm. Belonging. Tribe. Family. Clan. <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2008/10/oscillation-part-1.html">Pixels want pictures</a>.<br /><br /><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2008/pixel.placed.gif" alt="Happy pixel." /><br /><br />But culture is a mental object, an abstraction; it is distinguished. All distinction trades low-level detail for high-level power, so cultures <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span> diverge and mutually contradict. The logical possibilities at each level of abstraction are forks in the road, and someone will take each path. So while all people share bare consciousness, we <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span> identify with necessarily exclusive, totalizing cultures in order to gain personhood. Personhood is a mental object.<br /><br />Secularism and fundamentalism are the same. The humane, erudite secularist both demonizes and evangelizes the fundamentalist. Who doesn't think they're right? And yet who can avoid it, this thinking you're right, this identification with a culture? You make culture and culture makes you.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-7483487141862303460?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
