Leah is a Hannah Montana fan but is ashamed because I'm not. Tonight we landed in this conversation:<br /><blockquote>"It's not that I hate Hannah Montana, I just want to understand it. And I love you whether or not you love Hannah Montana. You're bigger than that."<br /><br />"I'm not bigger than it, it's bigger than me."<br /><br />"What is? Hannah Montana?"<br /><br />"Not just Hannah Montana, the whole thing. It's like it jumps out and grabs me and takes over. When I'm 11 it will fade away, like for Molly [her older neighbor friend and main connection to pop culture]."<br /><br />"Did she tell you that?"<br /><br />"No, I just thought it. It'll be like I'm out of jail."</blockquote>The conversation was richer than that, but it happened quickly and I knew during it that I would wish I remembered it better. I love that crap. I know[, Christy, ] that I'm supposed to not make her feel uncomfortable about Disney's latest money machine, that I'm ruining her. But I'd much rather raise kids that engage culture and actually understand it.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-4488581617505886951?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
