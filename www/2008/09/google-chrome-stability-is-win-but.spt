With its <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">new web browser</a>, Google aims to deliver simplicity, stability, and speed. The UI <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">is</span> nice and simple, but only marginally so over my usual Firefox setup. And the speed of the new JavaScript engine won't matter until people can build sites for it, and you've got the lowest common denominator problem there. Stability is the biggest immediate win. Yes, there are bugs:<div><br /></div><div><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2008/chrome-crash.png" /><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Now, if IE or Firefox present such a dialog, I know with the certainty of long habituation that clicking "OK" means saying good-bye to all of my open tabs. I usually observe a moment of silence before proceeding. It helps the healing process.But guess what happens when I click "OK" on the above dialog? Nothing. The dead tab is already closed, and Chrome doesn't skip a beat. I keep on browsing. Applying my applications. No mourning, no grief. Blip ... barely. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">That</span> is nice.</div><div><br /></div><div>You know what it took to turn "OK, please kill my productivity" into "OK, please stop interrupting me"? It took an entire bottom-up rewrite. That's a lot of work to make my life a little bit easier. I'm glad Google did that.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, I would be really paranoid about privacy if it weren't <a href="http://code.google.com/chromium/">open source</a>, and I'm still tempted to compile it myself (tip: delete <a href="http://src.chromium.org/svn/branches/official/build_149.27/src/chrome/browser/rlz/rlz.h">rzl.dll</a>). But I'll be <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">really</span>happy when they add a Python virtual machine. Their <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">server-side offering</a> is Python-based. Firefox has toyed with the idea (right?), and Microsoft has <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython">an implementation</a>. Hey, it could happen.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-3829405141470176687?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
