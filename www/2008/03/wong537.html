It turns out that when I'm drunk in my garage at 3AM, I sound a lot like David Wong (I learned this last weekend, from <a href="http://www.christyanity.com/">Christy</a>). I don't like sounding that crass online, so it's convenient that I have somewhere to link you that is both basically what I want to say and also not me:<br /><ul><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.pointlesswasteoftime.com/monkeysphere.html">Inside the Monkeysphere</a><br />Twelve Steps to Total Enlightenment<br /><br /></li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.pointlesswasteoftime.com/misery.html">7 Reasons the 21st Century is Making Us Miserable</a><br /><br /></li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_15663_god-fuse-10-things-christians-atheists-can-agree-on.html">The God Fuse</a><br />10 Things Christians and Atheists Can - and Must - Agree On<br /><br /></li><li style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_15746_embrace-horror.html">Embrace the Horror</a></li></ul>My favorite excerpt is from <span style="font-style: italic;">7 Reasons</span>, because of the photo (though he's a little wrong since building software is satisfying too):<br /><blockquote>You can line up for yourself a spread of your favorite liquor, your favorite video game, your favorite movie and your favorite sex act, and the sum total of them won't give you the same kind of lasting happiness you'd get from helping the cranky old lady down the street drag her garbage to the curb.<br /><br />This is why office jobs make so many of us miserable; you don't get to see the fruit of your labor. But work construction out in the hot sun for two months, and for the rest of your life you can drive past a certain house and say, "holy shit, <i>I built that.</i>"<br /><br />That level of satisfaction, the "I built that" or "I grew that" or "I fed that guy" or "I made these pants" feeling, can't be matched by anything the internet has to offer.<br /><br />Except, you know, this website.<br /><br /><img src="http://static.whit537.org/2008/amishwong.jpg" /></blockquote>It also reminds me of <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/12/who-are-my-gmail-contacts.html#351178611243637007">this comment</a> about social networking: "If I want to get in touch with my friends, I go visit them."
