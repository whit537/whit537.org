  <p style='text-autospace:none'><i>Dear Friends, Intercessors and Zion Aligned:</i></p>
  <p>We are heading into two of the most rearranging, realigning months that we 
    have ever known in the history of this generation. What occurs during these 
    days will set a course for our lives and this nation. The Lord woke me at 
    1 o'clock on Tuesday morning.  As I walked into the bathroom I noticed a calligraphy 
    verse: Lean not on your own understanding.  This verse lit up even though 
    the light was not on in the bathroom. The verse became red and yellow like 
    fire. When I went back in at 5 AM, I noticed that the verse was actually in 
    navy blue!  </p>
  <p>I heard the Lord begin to say: <b><i>Lean not on your own understanding today</i></b><i>.  
    I am calling you to watch the way that begins to form!  For I am forming and 
    reforming the way for My people! Abrasive circumstances will increase over 
    these next 40 days.  Lean not on your own understanding.  I will show you 
    things that you do not know during this time.  I will cause you to see the 
    pattern that I am forming.  Do not fall into an understanding of the past, 
    even the past 40 years, for in the next 40 days I am producing a new time 
    of understanding in My people. For My wisdom is not your wisdom.  I am creating 
    a fear and an awe of Me!  I will show you how evil is working.  I will let 
    you hear the voice of evil - that voice that has been distracting, confronting, 
    and taunting you.  My cause will rise up in you.  My words will form in your 
    mouth. You will speak it to the atmosphere and the atmosphere around you will 
    change.  I am forming a highway in your wilderness.  It will not be made of 
    shifting sand.  The foundation for your future is being laid.  I will cause 
    you to see the land that will be made sure for you.  Lean not on your own 
    understanding.  <b>Allow these next 40 days to be that which will change the 
    atmosphere from one of a mesmerizing force to the power of God in your midst.</b>  
    Honor ME with a shout!  Bless My Name. For My name is replacing the name of 
    the enemy on the gates of entry into your future. Where the enemy had your 
    gate blocked, I am now rising up to give you authority and entry into your 
    new place!</i>  </p>
  <p><i>Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.  
    In all your ways acknowledge Me and I will direct your path.  Do not just 
    look at your circumstances - do not lean on your own understanding!  Keep 
    your mind stayed upon Me.  Do not allow your abilities to be your trust.  I 
    will create a strong people that will rule in every sphere of authority.  <b>Spheres 
    of authority will be rearranged in these next 40 days.</b>  The power of My 
    words in your mouth will cause a break through.  Don't miss your window of 
    opportunity or fail to recognize the catalyst I am creating for rearranged 
    momentum. Receive an anointing to leap over the mountain that has been deceiving 
    and intimidating you. </i></p>
  <p><i>Don't be afraid of your storm this week for I will reorder your way and 
    will cause your times to be changed.  I'll set you ahead of that which would 
    overtake you and cause you to be overwhelmed. <b>So don't fear the storm. 
    Watch the rain and wind work to your benefit!</b>  Hear the keys shaking, 
    for I am rattling the gates of hell. Decree the blockade that wouldn't open 
    up and let you move forward, even in your emotions, is being unlocked and 
    that you are now able to move forward.</i></p>
  <p><i>Your path will become straight so that I might enter a new way.  What 
    is too high will come down and that which is too low will come up.  I can 
    bring the prideful into right order and bring the humble into a new place 
    of seeking.  I am creating a straight path for us to walk into the future.  
    May you see the path on which I will lead you into the future.  Allow Me to 
    come into your midst and prepare a way through this wilderness and into your 
    next place. I control the end from the beginning.  There is nothing that happens 
    in the earth realm that is outside of MY dominion.  Agree that My will <b>will</b> 
    be done on earth as it is in heaven this day.  Look up and see Me as the King 
    who reigns. See Heaven's highway forming in the earth realm around you.  <b>I 
    am not asking you to go under, but to come up!</b> Find the high way into 
    the place that I have for you. </i></p>
  <p><i>Hear My voice in the wilderness.  Though you have been unsure of the 
    way you are to go, today I am beginning to call you new and fresh.  This is 
    a time when you must not miss that window of momentum. Do not be content to 
    only sit and be taught every day because teaching alone will not get you to 
    your next place. You must have the anointing to leap over that mountain. My 
    call is being extended from the heavenly realm. <b>War for the next 21 days 
    to see My call come forth.</b> Those that will hear the call that I have for 
    them this hour know how to follow after the call that I am extending.  This 
    is not about a person you are following but a call that I am placing to set 
    a course for you out of one place and into another.  Hear the call! My voice 
    is entering into your valley and your wilderness and saying, Come up with 
    me!</i></p>
  <p><i>Now is the time of restructured vision.  Now is the time of finding your 
    place to stand on the land, a place that will not sink when you stand, a land 
    that will not confuse or entrap you.  Hear My voice in your wilderness.  For 
    in 40 days, I will begin to qualify those that have received and embraced 
    My call! Do not allow the enemy's voice to confuse you in the next few days. 
    <b>You will be  accosted by the enemy three times to keep you from finding 
    and standing firm on the highway that I am forming to bring you through and 
    into your new!  </b>Watch carefully and know the different voices this hour.  
    Voices will bring confusion into your atmosphere.  In the midst of this time 
    you must know what you are to follow.  This is a time when confusing voices 
    over your financial state and the state of the world would create a disheartening 
    emotion that would lead to fear.  I am the God of the gold and silver.  I 
    am the one who can shake loose new finances.  I am the one who can cause things 
    to be let go so you can move in and go through the gates I have for you.  
    Do not let a narrow, high path in front of you seem to be too steep for you 
    to climb.  I am making a straight path and causing you to be directed in a 
    new way these next 40 days.</i></p>
  <p><i>You have never been this way before.  Nations are hanging in the balance!  
    My Kingdom government will now begin to rise up and form to influence the 
    government of the earth.  I am a God who creates a Highway that can only be 
    seen by eyes who know My glory. You will know me as King and ruler.  I confounded 
    the gods of Egypt.  I confounded the Roman Empire.  </i></p>
  <p><i>Let Me form the words in your mouth to confront those things that would 
    keep you from finding the highway I have prepared in the wilderness. Only 
    My voice can guide you through and to this narrow road! In the midst of these 
    three confrontations, NOW I am forming the words for you to use to stop your 
    enemy from overtaking you. This is a corporate call for My people to rise 
    up.  In this corporate call you must be a people who knows how to confront 
    the atmospheric war around you.  </i></p>
  <p><i><b>I am raising up an abrasive time that will provoke you and produce 
    My jealousy in you so you rise up with a new war mantle against the forces 
    of hell in your midst.</b> I will raise the abrasion!  I will provoke MY people 
    to action.  Wake from your slumber and stupor and hear Me now to come forth! 
    Do not lean on your own understanding.  Go with My flow and watch Me make 
    a direct path.  Watch Me cause a path to come into order.  </i></p>
  <p><i>Renew the foundation. I am ready to build again.  I will begin to build 
    your future.  Activate that way that I am calling you.  Do not fear going 
    into the brush and the brambles to find the hidden treasure that you will 
    use to build My altar this hour.  Today I am activating you.  The intensity 
    of the time is now upon you.  I am activating you and calling you to hear 
    what is coming into your atmosphere. Be delivered from a deaf and dumb spirit 
    that would keep you from speaking and hearing at the right time.</i></p>
  <p><i>Rise up and create a path. Change an atmosphere and you will be able 
    to take a stand in that land.  Let Zion call forth.  I am calling forth to 
    Zion within you to rise up.  Prepare for a quick change.  Prepare for a quick 
    change.  Write the vision.  Make it plain.  <b>Prepare for a quick change. 
     I am calling for a new release of power over these 40 days.  Do not lean 
    on your own understanding.</b>  Go in My direction to create a power shift!

          </em></i></b>I greatly enjoyed writing my latest book, <i>Interpreting 
          the Times</i>.  This is my first book with Charisma House, and I am 
          very excited to see it released.  <i>Interpreting the Times</i> carries 
          the message of what I represent in the Body of Christ: the Issachar 
          Anointing.  This book will give you an idea of what it takes to make 
          it through narrow transitions.  This is a now book!  If ever we needed 
          to understand GOD in our time and space, it is NOW!&nbsp; This book 
          will move you to understand the &quot;process of time&quot; that may 
          presently be controlling you, into seeing your way into a place of future 
          victory!</p>
        <p>Have you ever noticed how often we use the word&nbsp;<em>TIME</em> 
          in our everyday conversation?&nbsp; Not only are we acutely aware of 
          the passage of time, but our speech is also littered with references 
          such as: we kill and waste time, time flies, or sometimes it crawls.&nbsp; 
          We refer to time in countless expressions and figures of speech.  </p>
        <p><em>In <b><a href="http://gloryofzion.org/webstore/Scripts/prodView.asp?idproduct=505" target="_blank">Interpreting 
          the Times</a>,</b></em> I tackle the subject of time, specifically as 
          it relates to God and our relationship with Him, addressing such questions 
          as:<br>
          * Is there a Creator who transcends and enters time to connect with 
          His children so we can efficiently walk in time?<br>
          * When we fail in one season, can He make us capable of redeeming the 
          times or buying back wasted time?<br>
          * Can He extend our horizon line and give us a glimpse of how to build 
          our future?<br>
          * How can communication from Heaven produce a reaction in the earth?<br>
          * In my valley of decision, how do I make the right choice?<br>
          * Will I miss my DAY or MOMENT?</p>
        <p>This book will move you to stop viewing time as a philosophy or a curse 
          and instead begin seeing it as a real gift from God. You will understand 
          better and gain a new perspective of the reality of space, time, Spirit, 
          and Truth as&nbsp;you advance through the pages. <em><strong>(INTRODUCTORY
