<p>Let's call <b>experience</b> <i>that which happens to an entity</i>, and let's call a <b>subject</b> <i>any entity that can process its own experience</i>. Then let's take <b>unprocessed experience</b> to be <i>the experience of a subject before it is processed</i>.</p><p>These assumptions yield what we might call a <b>processing theory of mind</b>, varying from the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/">computational theory of mind</a> in its relaxation of the requirement that the process be a computation (in a technical sense). By relaxing this requirement and importing our <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">scale language</a>, we now have a single, simple theory to explain itself and all other basic philosophies (in metaphysics, epistemology, ontology, phenomenology, philosophies of mind, consciousness, perception, etc.) as first-level <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">abstractions</a> atop unprocessed experience. Our theory accounts for fundamental philosophical variety through the <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">necessary loss of information</a> accompanying the abstraction away from unprocessed experience, and we can use the same <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2007/06/objects-scale-abstraction.html">simple tools</a> to work with everything above this basic philosophical level as well (science, art, the humanities, business, politics, religion, interpersonal relationships, etc.).</p><p>Booyah.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/36506138-727381703295651017?l=blag.whit537.org' alt='' /></div>
