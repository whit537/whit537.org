So <a href="http://blag.whit537.org/2008/03/lets-fix-christianity.html">we shouldn't say people are going to hell</a> (meaning specific people). But look here: we've invented a mechanism for conflict without killing: the market! In fact, the market actually turns conflict into a <span style="font-style: italic;">constructive</span> force!
