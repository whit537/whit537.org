        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <div id="back">&larr; <a href="./">Back</a></div>

<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t rewrite the Bible. This is the same old four
Gospels&mdash;Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John&mdash;laid out in a way that
hopefully makes them easier to read. Bibles have gotten so cluttered up with
chapter and verse numbers, footnotes, cross-references, charts, maps, drawings,
columns, sections, and sidebars that it&rsquo;s hard to actually read the text
straight through like a normal book. Besides that, the Bible is a big book.
It&rsquo;s all important, but the Gospels are the <i>most</i> important. It
should be easy for people to read the most important part of the Bible.</p>

<p>The <i>New English Bible</i> (<u>NEB</u>; Oxford/Cambridge, 1970) was my
main inspiration. I found it in a used-book shop in college, and fell in love
with it because it&rsquo;s so easy to read. All of the text is in one column,
and the chapter and verse numbers are in the margin instead of inline in the
text.  There are section headings every so often, but other than that there are
very few distractions.  My friends and I would read it out loud to each other.
If you pass the book around the room and each take a turn reading, it takes an
hour or two to get through one of the Gospels.  Unfortunately, the <u>NEB</u>
isn&rsquo;t in print anymore. Also, it was published as a full Bible or the New
Testament, but not just the Gospels.</p>

<p>Years later I led a Bible study group, and while in college we <i>read</i>
whole books at a time, in our Bible study we <i>discussed</i> whole books at a
time. We might read as much as a page or two at once, but it was up to each
person to read that week&rsquo;s book of the Bible on their own before the
meeting.</p>

<p>For our Bible study we used an edition called <i>The Books of The Bible</i>
(<u>TBOTB</u>, International Bible Society [<u>IBS</u>], 2007), which takes
<i>Today&rsquo;s New International Version</i> (<u>TNIV</u>) and does a few
interesting things with it. It sets it in one column, like the <u>NEB</u>.
Unlike the <u>NEB</u>, it puts abbreviated chapter and verse numbers in the
footer rather than in the margin, and uses unnumbered endnotes where the
<u>NEB</u> uses footnotes. It&rsquo;s nice not to have footnotes, but it turns
out that not having the full chapter and verse numbers is a step too far,
because then it&rsquo;s hard to get everyone to the same spot on the page,
especially if some people are using different translations.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing about <u>TBOTB</u> is how it reorders the books
of the Bible. The traditional order for the New Testament is:</p>

<table id="order">
    <tr><td class="number">4</td>
        <th>Gospels</th>
        <td>Matthew, Mark, Luke, John</td></tr>
    <tr><td></td>
        <th>Acts</th>
        <td>This is really Luke, Volume 2. Why is it after John?</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="number">21</td>
        <th>Letters</th>
        <td>These are more or less jumbled together.</td></tr>
    <tr><td></td>
        <th>Revelation</th>
        <td>This one does make sense at the end.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="no-indent">In <u>TBOTB</u>, the New Testament is organized as four
&ldquo;streams,&rdquo; each starting with a Gospel and then moving
chronologically through the books within the same sub-tradition.  For example,
Mark is followed by 1 and 2 Peter and Jude, because there&rsquo;s a popular
theory that the apostle Peter is the source behind Mark, and Jude is similar to
Peter&rsquo;s two letters. The different book order is the best part of
<u>TBOTB</u>. I&rsquo;m presenting the four Gospels together because I think
they are the most important part of the Bible, but I can imagine also putting
out separate volumes for each of the <u>TBOTB</u>&rsquo;s Gospel streams.</p>

<p>Sadly, <u>TBOTB</u> is ugly.  It&rsquo;s set in a clumsy font, the margins
are too small, and the paper is cheap.  The Bible&rsquo;s size does present a
challenge for a book designer, especially with a group like the <u>IBS</u> that
is focused on mass distribution and is trying to keep it affordable. Issuing
multiple volumes would drive up the cost, and might also under-emphasize the
thematic unity of the Bible.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t used them in a group setting, but I did take ideas from two
other editions of Scripture:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Richmond Lattimore&rsquo;s <i>The New Testament</i> (North Point, 1997)</li>
    <li><i>The Four Gospels</i> (Penguin, 2008)</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">The former is a good-quality paperback and is quite
readable. It has chapter/verse ranges in the header, and no section headings at
all. The Penguin edition is chock full of section headings. There are two or
three of them on every page, and they&rsquo;re in bold, with cross-references
in italics underneath. The chapter numbers are too large, the verse numbers are
inline, and the bottom of the page is cluttered with unhelpful footnotes.  The
only good thing about this edition is that it is just the four Gospels, the
only one like this I&rsquo;ve found so far.  Lattimore&rsquo;s out-of-print
first edition of Scripture (1962) included the Gospels and Revelation.</p>

<p>Those are the four editions of the Bible that I&rsquo;ve been most inspired
by.  Now for some notes on specific decisions I made when putting together this
edition.</p>

<div class="break"># # #</div>

<div class="borrowing"><b>Book Ordering</b>&mdash;With Richmond Lattimore, I
    changed the ordering of the Gospels:

    <table id="flipped">
        <tr>
            <th>Old</th>
            <th>New</th>
        </tr>
        <tr class="r0">
            <td class="book">Matthew</td>
            <td class="book">Mark</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="book">Mark</td>
            <td class="book">Matthew</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="book">Luke</td>
            <td class="book">Luke</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="book">John</td>
            <td class="book">John</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p class="no-indent">The reason to put Mark first is that the action moves
    faster, so it gives a better first impression of the Gospels overall.
    Matthew begins with a genealogy.  Read that same distance into Mark, and
    Jesus is already calling his first two disciples.  There is some historical
    justice to this switch as well, in that Mark is often thought to have been
    written first.

</div>

<div class="borrowing"><b>Chapter &amp; Verse</b>&mdash;Our chapters were
    devised in the early 1200&rsquo;s and our verses in 1551. They barely
    relate to the meaning of the text, but they are wonderful for
    cross-referencing thousands of years of scholarship. They also make it
    easier for a group of people reading the Bible together to find where they
    are. For readability I followed the <u>NEB</u>&rsquo;s lead and put the
    chapter and verse numbers in the margin.</div>

<div class="borrowing"><b>Page Scrolling</b>&mdash;I came up with this idea to
    be able to scroll through a book as if it were a web page, and now I see
    that the latest phone book from Verizon has done the same thing! It must be
    a good idea.  Here, a black tab is printed on the right edge of the right
    page, representing the current Gospel. View the book edge on, and the tabs
    show the extent of each Gospel within the book as a whole.  The height and
    edge-on width of the tab is proportional to the size of that Gospel. Open
    the book, and the numbers next to the tab are the chapters present on the
    two currently-open pages.  They are positioned according to the distance of
    the chapter through the current Gospel.

    <p>Page scrolling is designed so that as one leafs through the pages like a
    flipbook, the book tabs and chapter numbers scroll down the side of the
    page.  This helps to quickly locate book and chapter references.  The verse
    numbers on the inside margin then help locate verse references. The numbers
    in the footer on the outside are regular page numbers.

    <p>Page scrolling began life as a sparkline at the bottom of the page, so I
    have Edward Tufte to thank for its inspiration. It&rsquo;s also related to
    how we marked the edges of our Greek and Hebrew dictionaries in
    college.</div>

<div class="borrowing"><b>Punctuation</b>&mdash;In the spirit of Cormac
    McCarthy (e.g., <i>The Road</i>, Knopf, 2006), I removed single and double
    quotation marks, and I replaced semicolons with commas. Maybe this is a
    fad, but it&rsquo;s also a return: not only did the ancient texts have no
    punctuation whatsoever, but the immediate ancestor of the text adapted here
    also did not use quotation marks (the <u>WEB</u> adds them to the
    <u>ASV</u>; see <i>Translation</i>).</div>

<div class="borrowing"><b>Scope</b>&mdash;As with <i>The Four Gospels</i>, this
    edition only includes the four Gospels. I don&rsquo;t want people to miss
    out on the Gospels just because the whole Bible or even the whole New
    Testament is overwhelming.

    <p>I encourage any reader to also read anything and everything
    else&mdash;New Testament, Bible, Gnostic texts, other apocrypha, other
    scriptures, modern books, etc. I see the Gospels as a centerpoint, and not
    a boundary line.</div>

<div class="borrowing"><b>Sections</b>&mdash;I added sections to the Gospels,
    to give a sense of the flow of the story for each Gospel, and to make it
    easy to divide up a Gospel over multiple sessions of a reading group. I
    call these <i>sections</i> and use letters to denote them because the word
    <i>chapter</i> with numerals is already taken.  Sections are indicated at
    the bottom inside of the right page.

    <p>These are different from the sections in other editions because they are
    large in scope, they are untitled, and they actually start a new page.
    These sections are designed to feel like chapter breaks in a novel, giving
    you a place to stop if you really must get to bed, but at the same time
    drawing you onwards&mdash;&ldquo;Just one more chapter!&rdquo; There are 34
    of them all told, and their size varies considerably according to the flow
    of the story for each Gospel.</div>

<div class="borrowing"><b>Translation</b>&mdash;I used the <i>World English
        Bible</i> because it&rsquo;s the best translation that I could use for
    free.  It&rsquo;s a literal translation, a light modernization of the
    <i>American Standard Version</i>, and therefore a descendent of the <i>King
        James Version</i> and a sibling of the <i>New American Standard
        Version</i>.  Michael Paul Johnson is the editor, and it is available
    in multiple formats at <a href="http://www.ebible.org">ebible.org</a>.

    <p>I would probably rather use a less literal translation, but which
    translation to use is not the most important thing.  Someone who likes to
    study the Bible will own several translations. Someone who is less
    interested won&rsquo;t appreciate the subtle differences between them
    anyway.  One way to offset the potential difficulty of this translation is
    to read the Gospels together as a group, because in a group setting better
    readers can help others. If everyone participates in shared reading, it
    builds confidence as well as community.</div>

<div class="borrowing"><b>Typography</b>&mdash;This is my first time
    typesetting a book, so I thought it best to try to imitate a classic: the
    <u>NEB</u>. I referred often to Robert Bringhurst&rsquo;s <i>The Elements
        of Typographical Style</i> (v3.2, Hartley &amp; Marks, 2008) to
    understand the <u>NEB</u>&rsquo;s technique.</div>


<div class="break"># # #</div>

<p>The Gospels introduced something into human affairs that it is important to
come to terms with, and the best way to do that is to actually read them.  I
hope that this edition helps you to read the Gospels, both on your own and with
others.</p>

<p>Lastly, I&rsquo;d like to thank Jessica Whitacre, Leah Whitacre, Miriam
Whitacre, Rod Whitacre, Steven Brown, Craig McClean, Kirk Botula, Ed Schrothe,
Edward Tufte, Chris Mulligan, Ben Butler, and David Yun for providing feedback
on earlier versions of this book.</p>
