    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <p>Greetings, program! I&rsquo;m the founder of <a
        href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a>, a platform for sustainable
    crowd-funding based on small weekly cash gifts. Gittip launched in June,
    2012, and as of March, 2013, it currently has about 800 active users
    exchanging about $2,200 per week in gifts. Gittip is funded on Gittip. My
    background is in programming, and I wrote the <a
        href="http://aspen.io/">Aspen</a> web framework that Gittip uses, as
    well as the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gheat/">Gheat</a> heatmapper
    and the <a href="/mongs/">Mongs</a> database browser. I also started a
    small publishing company called <a
        href="http://www.logstown.com/">Logstown</a>.  I live outside
    Pittsburgh with my wife and four kids, and I have strong interests in
    religion and philosophy.</p>
